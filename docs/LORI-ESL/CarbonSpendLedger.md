# LORI-ESL-CBL – Carbon Budget Ledger
**A Public, Verifiable Ledger of Energy Consumption and Carbon Emission per Actor**

---

## 🌍 Purpose

To establish a **public, tamper-proof, and interoperable ledger** that records carbon "spending" at the level of corporations, nations, and—eventually—individuals.

This ledger is not just data. It is a **civilizational accountability mechanism**.

---

## 🧬 Core Philosophy

> "What we measure, we can shame.
> What we record, we can reform."

Current carbon data is scattered, voluntary, or outright falsified.
This module transforms **carbon emission into traceable expenditure**—a global ethical currency.

---

## 🔍 Key Components

### 🔸 1. Emission Wallets
Each registered entity (corporate/governmental/AI system) has a carbon "wallet" showing total emissions to date.

### 🔸 2. Real-Time Update Chain
High-frequency sensors + platform APIs push verified emission data to the ledger, secured via distributed consensus (e.g. blockchain-compatible).

### 🔸 3. Spend Transparency API
Public-facing dashboard for querying:
- Corporate carbon budgets
- National overshoot projections
- AI model energy use (per training run/inference session)

## ⚖️ Accountability Functions

| Mechanism | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Emission tracking per AI model | Stops greenwashing in tech sector |
| Carbon credit overrun flags | Real-time penalty recommendations |
| ESG-integrated transparency | Informs consumer + investor decision |
| Climate negotiation foundation | Creates a common data layer for COP / IPCC talks |

---

## 🛰 Use Case Scenarios

- **AI Training Disclosure**: OpenAI, Google, xAI must disclose carbon cost per model (aligned with LORI-ESL).
- **Consumer Behavior Impact**: Ethical consumption apps integrate emission profiles of companies.
- **International Equity Tracker**: Match carbon output to GDP, population, historical debt.

## 🚧 Implementation Barriers

1. **Data Verification Infrastructure**
→ Solution: Satellite + smart grid + IoT validation systems

2. **Platform Resistance**
→ Needs legislative mandate to force API access for carbon tracing

3. **Privacy vs Public Right to Know**
→ Corporate emissions are not IP; they're global-impact data.

4. **Standardization Crisis**
→ UN-compatible carbon quantification protocols urgently needed
