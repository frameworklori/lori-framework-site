# USPTO Precedential Impact Summary  
## Ex parte Desjardins et al. (Appeal 2024-000567, Precedential, November 4, 2025)

---

### 🏛️ 1. Case Overview

**Case Title:** *Ex parte Guillaume Desjardins et al.*  
**Application No.:** 16/319,040  
**Appeal No.:** 2024-000567  
**Technology Center:** 2100 – Artificial Intelligence and Data Processing  
**Decision Date:** November 4, 2025  
**Designation:** *Precedential* (binding precedent within USPTO)  
**Panel:**  
- John A. Squires – Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property & USPTO Director  
- Valencia Martin Wallace – Acting Commissioner for Patents  
- Michael W. Kim – Vice Chief Administrative Patent Judge

### ⚖️ 2. Legal Outcome

The Appeals Review Panel (ARP) **vacated** the PTAB’s new ground of rejection under **35 U.S.C. § 101**, which had classified the claims as “abstract mathematical concepts.”

**Key holding:**
> “On review, we vacate the Board’s new ground of rejection.  
> We do not disturb the Board’s previous decisions in any other respects.”

This means that **the machine-learning training method described** was found to be a **patent-eligible technical implementation**, not a mere abstract idea.

### 🧠 3. Claimed Invention Summary

The invention relates to **training machine learning models** in a way that:

1. Uses **two different learning tasks** (“first” and “second” tasks).  
2. Computes **posterior distributions** over model parameters.  
3. Assigns **importance weights** to parameters from the first task.  
4. Trains the model on the second task **while preserving** performance on the first.  

> Essentially, this describes a *multi-task learning optimization technique* that prevents catastrophic forgetting —  
> a foundational principle for continual and transfer learning.

---

### 🔍 4. Legal Significance

This decision **broadens patent eligibility for AI systems** that:
- Involve *training procedures*, not just final model outputs.  
- Implement *technical improvements* to how learning or inference occurs.  
- Apply *probabilistic or Bayesian weighting* during model optimization.  

It establishes that **AI training pipelines** can be recognized as **“technological processes”** under §101 —  
not abstract mathematical theories.

### 🧩 5. Relevance to the LORI Framework

The **LORI Framework’s modules** embody the same class of innovations upheld in this case.

| LORI Module | Relevant Correspondence | Legal Support from Desjardins Decision |
|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **ODRAF** – Outcome-Driven Risk Anticipation Framework | Multi-stage task training & parameter weighting | Confirms such architectures are patent-eligible under §101 |
| **LAIM** – Language Authorship Identification Model | Uses posterior distributions over linguistic features | Posterior-based model training upheld as technical process |
| **AIDM** – AI Infiltration Detection Module | Preserves prior-task memory during retraining | Reinforced by “preserving performance on prior tasks” clause |
| **ZTV / LimitNet** | Optimization via behavioral weighting & protection metrics | Validated as training optimization, not abstraction |

Thus, this case directly strengthens the **patent defensibility and technical recognition** of LORI Framework AI modules.

### 🧱 6. Recommended Citation in Future LORI Submissions

When referencing this precedent in future patent or licensing filings:

> “See *Ex parte Desjardins et al.*, Appeal 2024-000567 (PTAB Precedential 2025),  
> confirming that multi-task learning methods involving posterior weighting and cross-task performance preservation  
> constitute patent-eligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101.”

### 🪙 7. Strategic Integration Notes (for LORI Legal Architecture)

- **Use Case:** Attach this citation in the *Background / Patent Eligibility* section of all LORI AI-related USPTO filings.  
- **Licensing:** Reference this as a baseline to justify commercial valuation of training architectures.  
- **Defense:** If challenged under §101 (abstract idea), cite this case to assert “technical implementation of model training.”  
- **Documentation:** File this decision under `/docs/legal/precedent/` as part of the *LORI Ethical Documentation Policy v1.0*.
