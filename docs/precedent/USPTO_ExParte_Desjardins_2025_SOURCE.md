### 🔗 Integration Note (LORI Framework)
This decision establishes that **AI training methods** involving:
- multi-task learning,
- posterior distribution weighting, and
- performance preservation across training tasks

are **patent-eligible technical implementations** under 35 U.S.C. § 101.

Accordingly, this ruling supports the patent eligibility of LORI Framework modules such as:
- **ODRAF** (Outcome-Driven Risk Anticipation Framework)
- **LAIM** (Language Authorship Identification Model)
- **AIDM** (AI Infiltration Detection Module)

These modules share similar computational characteristics, reinforcing the
**technical and legal foundation of the LORI Ethical System**.
