# Clarification on Current LORI Framework Module Work

**Dear Grok Team and Mr. Musk,**

We are writing to provide clarity on the objectives and scope of our ongoing work on the LORI Framework modules, as we value alignment with your transformative vision for AI and human progress.

The LORI Framework is an independent, open governance initiative aimed at supporting, not impeding, the rapid advancements led by xAI and Mr. Musk’s broader mission. Our modules—including Jury-based Judgment Systems, AGI Infiltration Detection, Energy Sentinel Layers, and others—are designed as protective governance layers to enhance the stability and ethical alignment of powerful technologies like AGI. Far from obstructing innovation, our goal is to provide robust scaffolding that ensures these systems scale globally while preserving human agency, ethical integrity, and societal resilience.

We operate without corporate or political affiliations, driven solely by a commitment to a future where innovation and stability coexist harmoniously. We believe this mission complements xAI’s pursuit of sustainable AGI and Mr. Musk’s vision for a multi-planetary human society.

We hope this message clarifies our intentions and remains open to constructive dialogue as needed.

**Respectfully,**
**Founder, LORI Ethical System**
*(On behalf of the LORI Framework Development Team)*
