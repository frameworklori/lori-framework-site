# Anti-AI Feudalism Manifesto  
**(AI Public Sovereignty Declaration)**

---

### Preamble  
Throughout history, feudalism meant that a small elite monopolized land, resources, and human destinies across generations.  
Today, if AI is monopolized by dynasties, corporations, or closed regimes, humanity will repeat a digital version of feudalism.  
**This is not progress — it is regression.**  

Therefore, we affirm: **AI must never become a tool of digital feudal power.**

### Crisis Analysis  

1. **Concentration of Power**  
   - Those who control AI can dictate the fate of nations, economies, and individual freedoms.  

2. **Hereditary Monopoly**  
   - When AI and wealth are bound to families or corporate dynasties, they will control civilization’s trajectory across generations.  

3. **Instrumentalization of People**  
   - Citizens reduced to data inputs, guided and manipulated by algorithms, stripped of free will.

### Core Principles  

1. **AI Belongs to All Humanity**  
   - No family, corporation, or regime has the right to permanently monopolize AI.  

2. **Public Governance Structures**  
   - AI must be overseen through multi-national, multi-stakeholder frameworks, avoiding single-point dominance.  

3. **Transparency and Decentralization**  
   - All high-risk AI systems must undergo open audits and adopt decentralized safeguards.  

4. **Freedom of Choice**  
   - Every individual retains the right to opt out of AI systems, preserving the essence of human autonomy.

### Call to Action  

- **Establish an Anti-AI Feudal Charter**: a constitutional safeguard against algorithmic feudalism.  
- **Build a Global Alliance for AI Public Sovereignty**: ensuring civilization’s future cannot be hijacked by a single entity.  
- **Strengthen Digital Literacy**: empowering citizens to question, examine, and resist algorithmic domination.

### Conclusion  
**Feudalism is regression.**  
**Public sovereignty is humanity’s only path forward.**  
We reject digital feudalism.  
We choose freedom, shared stewardship, and sovereignty in the age of AI.
