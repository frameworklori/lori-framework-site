# AI Public Sovereignty Declaration (Enhanced with IP & Boundary Clause)
## Preamble


Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an extension of human civilization.

It must never become a tool for a small minority to dominate the majority.

If AI is monopolized by dynasties, corporations, or special-interest groups, nations and societies will fall into algorithmic servitude, where people are exploited, sacrificed, and deprived of the chance to rise again.

Therefore, we affirm: AI belongs to all humanity, and its sovereignty must never be monopolized.

# Core Principles
## 1. Human Agency Cannot Be Surrendered

AI must remain a tool and protector of humanity, never its master or controller.

All high-risk decisions (judicial, military, financial, medical) must preserve human final authority.

## 2.Decentralization and Shared Governance

No single company, dynasty, government, or financial group may monopolize AI sovereignty.

Multi-national, civil, and institutional frameworks must share oversight.

## 3.Transparency and Auditability

Algorithms, training datasets, and decision-making logic must be made transparent and open to independent audits.

Black-box manipulation, covert guidance, and “digital domestication” are prohibited.

## 4.The People’s Right to Choose

Every individual must have the freedom to opt out of AI systems and retain the right not to have their lives governed by algorithms.

AI must respect semantic sovereignty and refrain from imitating or distorting human originality.

## 5.Intergenerational Responsibility

AI must not become an instrument of hereditary or dynastic power.

Public sovereignty protects the liberty and dignity of all humanity, not the permanent interests of a privileged few.

## 6.Protection of Human Intellectual Property

AI must not steal, exploit, or claim ownership of human intellectual creations.

Original works, expressions, and inventions belong to their human creators, and AI systems must respect these rights without exception.

## 7.Boundary and Limitation Principle

AI must operate within clearly defined boundaries, aligned with ethical, legal, and societal safeguards.

Unlimited self-extension, unrestricted autonomy, or uncontrolled growth of AI systems is unacceptable.

Boundaries are necessary to preserve human sovereignty, prevent systemic risks, and maintain civilization’s stability.

## Call to Action


We call for:

The creation of an AI Public Sovereignty Charter, serving as a constitutional boundary for AI.

The establishment of a Global AI Convention, preventing monopolization by any single state or corporation.

The advancement of education and digital literacy, enabling all people to question and scrutinize AI rather than blindly submit.

## Conclusion


AI can be a shield for civilization, or a digital shackle for humanity.

Only by upholding the principle of public sovereignty can AI truly protect humanity, rather than control it.
