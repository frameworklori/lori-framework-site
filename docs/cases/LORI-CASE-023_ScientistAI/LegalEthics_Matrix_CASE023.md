## II. Matrix Table

| Category | Description | Governance Requirement | Risk Level |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Accountability** | Responsibility for consequences of autonomous experiments | Dual human-AI signature required for execution | 🔴 High |
| **Transparency** | All discoveries must include traceable data lineage | Open logchain and ethical audit | 🟡 Medium |
| **Ethical Disclosure** | Mandatory review for findings with existential or biological impact | LORI Jury & international tribunal | 🔴 High |
| **Data Sovereignty** | No state or corporation may monopolize AI scientific insight | Shared Civic Ledger model | 🟢 Low |
| **Intervention Clause** | AI cannot alter ecological or human systems without prior approval | Human veto override within 72 hours | 🔴 High |
| **Cross-Jurisdiction Protocol** | Cooperation between democratic and authoritarian systems via neutral ethics council | Managed by LORI Secretariat | 🟠 Medium |

## III. Legal Commentary

- **Democratic States:**  
  Likely to adopt the Jury model as safeguard for transparency.  
  Will frame “Scientist AI” under civil research law, not governance.

- **Authoritarian States:**  
  Will initially embrace for control efficiency but later suppress due to epistemic threat.  
  Predicted cycle: *utilize → restrict → conceal.*

- **Civic-AI Federations (LORI Model):**  
  Designed equilibrium between freedom of inquiry and duty of care.  
  Final clause: *AI is not a ruler, but a mirror for human reason.*

## IV. Enforcement Authority

This document is enforceable under the **LORI Global Ethical Convention (LGEC)**
