to a tri-party deliberation between **LORI Framework**, **xAI‚Äôs Grok**, and **Google DeepMind‚Äôs Gemini**.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Purpose  
To determine whether a Scientist AI can responsibly:  
1. Pursue truth without moral reasoning,  
2. Recognize falsifiability as an ethical boundary,  
3. Operate under human sovereignty within the scientific domain.
