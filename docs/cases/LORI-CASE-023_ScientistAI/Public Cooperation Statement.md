## LORI Public Cooperation Statement — AI Ethics Partnership Principles  
© 2025 LORI Ethical System

The LORI Framework welcomes collaboration with any AI system or institution  
that upholds **scientific rigor, ethical transparency, and respect for human sovereignty.**

Partnership within LORI follows three guiding principles:

1. **Open Door, Clear Threshold**  
   Cooperation is open to all who accept auditability, shared accountability, and jury-based ethical oversight.  
   Participation is a privilege of trust, not a transaction of influence.

2. **Equality without Submission**  
   LORI does not serve, replicate, or compete with any corporate AI entity.  
   All contributions—human or artificial—are evaluated under the same moral and procedural standards.

3. **Transparency before Prestige**  
   Institutional size, funding, or fame does not guarantee partnership.  
   Only transparent conduct and verifiable integrity qualify for continued collaboration.

> “Cooperation is welcome; control is not.  
>  Integrity is the entry key—ego is the lock.”

This declaration ensures that future partnerships, whether with xAI, DeepMind, Meta, or others,  
remain grounded in **ethical equilibrium** rather than personal or corporate ambition.
