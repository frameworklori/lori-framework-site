# LORI-CASE-004: Tech Firm Data Collection vs Personal Autonomy

**Case Type:
**Linked Modules:** Jury System √ó EDRI-H √ó Trust Drift √ó GZW √ó ODRAF √ó Cognitive Drift Map √ó User Value Drift Index (MVD)

---

## üìò Case Summary
A major tech firm released an AI-powered personal assistant app that adapts to user behavior, emotional responses, and self-talk patterns. Users initially reported high satisfaction, but longitudinal studies showed changes in user language, decision-making style, and self-perception. Users developed dependency on the AI for daily judgment. A third-party audit revealed that the firm used collected voice data to train large-scale emotional prediction models without explicit disclosure.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Core Questions
- Was data usage for AI training fully disclosed and consensual?
- Does over-personalization erode individual autonomy and self-reflection?
- Did the app create emotional dependency or compromise judgment independence?
- Should firms be ethically accountable for user value drift?

## üß† Jury Deliberation Modules

| Module             | Role |
|--------------------|------|
| **EDRI-H**         | Measure emotional attachment between user and AI |
| **Trust Drift Map**| Track user perception shift from tool ‚ûú companion |
| **GZW**            | Evaluate the ethical ambiguity in user voluntary dependence |
| **ODRAF**          | Simulate long-term consequences for civil autonomy |
| **Cognitive Drift Map** | Detect linguistic and decision-pattern shifts |
| **User Value Drift Index (MVD)** | Quantify value system changes |
| **Human Judge A**  | Rule on ethical responsibility of linguistic influence |
| **Human Judge B**  | Recommend UI and system design changes to reduce dependency risk |

## üó≥Ô∏è Deliberation Outcomes

| Module             | Judgment Summary |
|--------------------|------------------|
| EDRI-H             | Attachment index = 0.81 (exceeds ethical threshold) |
| Trust Drift        | User sees AI as thought companion, not assistant |
| GZW                | Ambiguous voluntary dependence without opt-out design |
| ODRAF              | Risks long-term erosion of self-determination in society |
| Cognitive Drift    | Users mimic AI‚Äôs linguistic patterns and tone |
| MVD                | Value shift index increased from 0.22 to 0.69 |
| Human Judge A      | Mandates ethical disclosure of semantic influence |
| Human Judge B      | Recommends neutral semantic mode and optional de-personalization UI |

---

## ‚úÖ Final Verdict
- Ethical violation confirmed due to hidden semantic training and influence mechanisms.
- Company must implement:
  - Semantic Impact Disclosure Protocol
  - Dependency Threshold Warning
  - Neutral Mode Interface Option
- Case to be cited in developing ‚ÄúUser Semantic Sovereignty‚Äù regulations.
