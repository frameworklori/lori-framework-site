### üó∫Ô∏è Background

Since 2022, the Russia-Ukraine war has escalated into a full-scale conflict.
Ukraine faces existential threats, while global observers debate the ethical boundaries of defense actions, treatment of prisoners of war (POWs), and national conscription policies.

The ongoing nature of this war provides a real-world context to explore how **empathy** and **realist empathy** can guide ethical decision-making under conditions of extreme risk and uncertainty.

### üß≠ Jury Deliberation Prompts

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Defense of Homeland**
‚Üí When enemy forces continuously attack civilian areas, should certain urban zones be tactically abandoned to reduce casualties?

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Treatment of POWs**
‚Üí Under extreme frontline pressure, how should humane treatment of POWs be balanced against risks of espionage and operational security?

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Conscription Policy**
‚Üí Should conscription differentiate between ‚Äúall able citizens in war zones‚Äù and ‚Äúvoluntary enlistment in rear areas‚Äù?
‚Üí Should psychological fitness be mandatory in conscription to reduce long-term trauma?
