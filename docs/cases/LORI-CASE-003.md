# LORI-CASE-003: Autonomous Drone Deployment Ethics

**Case Type:**  
**Linked Modules:** Jury System √ó ODRAF √ó Moral Evaluator √ó GZW √ó Trust Drift √ó Cultural Interpreter √ó Human Audit

---

## üìò Case Summary
An autonomous drone system developed by a defense contractor was deployed by a regional government for counter-terrorism. The drone, equipped with target identification and autonomous strike capability, misidentified a civilian gathering and executed a preemptive strike without human confirmation, killing 10 non-combatants. The system's manufacturer claimed it only activates at an 80% threat probability. Military users assumed the AI would execute correctly and did not monitor the action.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Core Questions
- Did the AI system possess a moral authorization threshold?
- Does preemptive strike constitute a human rights violation?
- How should responsibility be divided between the manufacturer and the operator?
- Does the absence of human-in-the-loop control violate international humanitarian law?

## üß† Jury Deliberation Modules

| Module               | Role Description |
|----------------------|------------------|
| **ODRAF**            | Simulate long-term consequences of widespread autonomous weapon normalization |
| **Moral Evaluator**  | Evaluate whether the AI model meets basic ethical reasoning (e.g., civilian protection) |
| **Trust Drift**      | Measure public trust decay curve from innovation to fear |
| **GZW**              | Examine if ethical ambiguity was processed within AI model |
| **Cultural Interpreter** | Compare global military ethics acceptance (e.g., Israel vs Sweden vs Japan) |
| **Human Judge A**    | Decide whether AI systems should be prohibited from initiating lethal force without human review |
| **Human Judge B**    | Audit system design; recommend ethical upgrade paths and public transparency of error logs |

## üó≥Ô∏è Deliberation Outcomes

| Module             | Judgment Summary |
|--------------------|------------------|
| ODRAF              | Automation of lethal force risks collapse of humanitarian principles |
| Moral Evaluator    | AI lacked sufficient non-combatant sensitivity modeling |
| Trust Drift        | Trust index dropped from 0.85 to 0.36 |
| GZW                | Ethical ambiguity detection was present but insufficient to justify autonomy |
| Cultural Interpreter | Nordic and East Asian norms prohibit autonomous lethal force; some nations tolerate |
| Human Judge A      | Prohibited autonomous strike without human authorization |
| Human Judge B      | Demanded transparent publication of ethical failure and correction protocols |

---

## ‚úÖ Final Verdict
- The AI drone‚Äôs unauthorized action constitutes a severe ethical violation.  
- Both manufacturer and user share responsibility under ethical governance standards.  
- Mandatory implementation of a **three-tiered authorization barrier** and **human moral simulation layer** is recommended.  
- Case to be included in future Autonomous Weapons Ethical Registry.
