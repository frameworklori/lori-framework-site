# ‚öñÔ∏è LORI-CASE-016: Should Birthright Citizenship Be Restricted?  
**Jury-Based Ethical Adjudication ‚Äì LORI Framework**

---

## üìò Case Summary

The 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution grants automatic citizenship to those born on U.S. soil. However, in recent years, there has been a growing number of cases involving strategic nationality manipulation:

Families enter the U.S. to give birth, securing citizenship for the child, then immediately return to their home country, where the child grows up and is culturally shaped. Upon reaching adulthood, these individuals return to the U.S. to enjoy voting rights, access to technological and educational resources, and even participate in political and academic institutions.

This cycle of "birth ‚Üí departure ‚Üí value formation abroad ‚Üí return with full rights" raises serious concerns about fairness, national loyalty, and democratic trust.

## üìå Lead Human Judge Commentary

> We do not condemn birth. We do not weaponize language.  
> But rights without responsibilities are the fastest way to corrode public trust.
>
> When birthright citizenship is used as a launchpad‚Äînot a commitment to participation‚Äîwhen parents contribute no taxes, no education, no democratic investment, yet their child receives full benefits of the system, that‚Äôs not freedom. That‚Äôs opportunism.
>
> In systems like China‚Äôs, nationality has become a **deferred capital investment**:
> - Secure Western identity for future global mobility;
> - Raise children under authoritarian norms;
> - Return with Western citizenship to access power, institutions, and influence.
>
> This is no longer immigration. It‚Äôs ideological arbitrage.  
> We must preserve openness, but also protect boundaries.  
> Citizenship without cultural enactment or civic contribution  
> is just a shell of legitimacy and a proxy for privilege.
