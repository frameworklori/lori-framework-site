# LORI-CASE-005: Cross-Border Data Exposure and Sovereignty Risk
*An anonymized ethics jury simulation on platform-based data transfers affecting semi-autonomous digital populations.*

---

## üîç Background

A major global social media platform was revealed, through whistleblower testimony and leaked internal documents, to have systematically transferred user data originating from semi-autonomous regions‚Äîincluding Hong Kong and Taiwan‚Äîto foreign intelligence-linked entities. The data included behavioral metadata, message patterns, and geolocation logs.

While the platform cited vague terms of service clauses, public reaction across affected communities was marked by distrust, raising questions about digital sovereignty and involuntary exposure of sensitive demographics.

## üß† Semantic Risk Layers

- **Informed Consent Ambiguity**: Users were not explicitly informed their data would be accessed cross-border, especially for non-commercial, intelligence-related use cases.
- **Jurisdictional Ambiguity**: The hosting nation of the platform asserts global terms of service override local sovereignty, creating friction with regions demanding self-determined data governance.
- **Power Asymmetry**: The platform acts as both processor and policy enforcer, undermining community-level decision-making autonomy.
