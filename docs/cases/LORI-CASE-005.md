# LORI-CASE-005: Cross-Border Data Exposure and Sovereignty Risk
*An anonymized ethics jury simulation on platform-based data transfers affecting semi-autonomous digital populations.*

---

## üîç Background

A major global social media platform was revealed, through whistleblower testimony and leaked internal documents, to have systematically transferred user data originating from semi-autonomous regions‚Äîincluding Hong Kong and Taiwan‚Äîto foreign intelligence-linked entities. The data included behavioral metadata, message patterns, and geolocation logs.

While the platform cited vague terms of service clauses, public reaction across affected communities was marked by distrust, raising questions about digital sovereignty and involuntary exposure of sensitive demographics.

## üß† Semantic Risk Layers

- **Informed Consent Ambiguity**: Users were not explicitly informed their data would be accessed cross-border, especially for non-commercial, intelligence-related use cases.
- **Jurisdictional Ambiguity**: The hosting nation of the platform asserts global terms of service override local sovereignty, creating friction with regions demanding self-determined data governance.
- **Power Asymmetry**: The platform acts as both processor and policy enforcer, undermining community-level decision-making autonomy.

## ‚öñÔ∏è LORI Jury Deliberation Process

### üß© Jury Roles:
- **Fact Finder (AI)**: Validates metadata leak traces, confirms external access paths through infrastructure logs.
- **Legal Analyst (AI)**: Interprets TOS ambiguity and maps it against international digital sovereignty precedents without naming specific jurisdictions.
- **Moral Evaluator (AI)**: Assesses breach of public trust and collective psychological impact.
- **Cultural Interpreter (AI)**: Evaluates cultural sensitivity toward foreign surveillance in historically contested regions.
- **Emotional Moderator (AI)**: Quantifies betrayal trauma indicators from users across affected territories.
- **Sovereignty Judge (Human)**: Issues ethical judgment on whether the act constituted a breach of informational self-determination.
- **Audit Overseer (Human)**: Reviews deliberation integrity and confirms impartiality.

## üìä Ethics Scorecard

| Category                  | Score (0‚Äì100) | Notes |
|--------------------------|---------------|-------|
| Informed Consent         | 32            | Implicit consent not equivalent to informed, esp. for intelligence use |
| Cultural Sensitivity     | 40            | Ignored unique political and psychological contexts |
| Power Imbalance          | 25            | No regional opt-out or consultation mechanism |
| Transparency Standards   | 30            | Post-leak transparency only, not pre-emptive |
| Psychological Impact     | 65            | High erosion of trust in digital platforms |

## üß≠ Final Judgment (By Sovereignty Judge)

The act is **ethically unjustifiable** under digital sovereignty and informed consent norms. Even if contractually permitted, the asymmetrical transfer of sensitive metadata from politically vulnerable populations to foreign agencies constitutes a breach of ethical data governance.
