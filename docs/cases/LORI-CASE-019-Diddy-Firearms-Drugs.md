## 1. 🎯 Case Context

**Case Title:** United States v. Sean "Diddy" Combs (Firearms & Narcotics Possession)
**LORI Reference:** LORI-CASE-019
**Classification:** Non-Discretionary Federal Crime with Physical Evidence
**Status:** Under Investigation / Pre-Charge Public Domain
**Jurisdiction:** United States Federal Law (FBI jurisdiction)
**Sensitivity Level:** High – Celebrity + Controlled Substances + Weapons

---

In March 2024, federal agents executed a search warrant on Sean “Diddy” Combs’s residence in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles. The FBI confirmed recovery of multiple controlled substances (including Schedule I & II drugs such as cocaine, MDMA, and ketamine) and unregistered firearms, including both handguns and long-barrel rifles.

The discovery was reportedly part of a larger investigation into potential racketeering and trafficking operations linked to Combs’s entertainment network, but the drug and firearms charges stand independently under federal law.

Unlike other aspects of the broader case which may hinge on testimony, intent, or jury perception (e.g., sex trafficking or racketeering), the **possession of illegal narcotics and firearms falls under strict liability statutes**. These crimes are enforceable based on material evidence alone, requiring no subjective interpretation by a jury.

### 📌 Relevance to LORI Framework

This case provides a baseline scenario for LORI’s legal module to demonstrate:
- Clear-cut federal violation modeling without reliance on jury subjectivity;
- The role of **direct material evidence** in AI-based legal inference;
- Risk amplification when controlled substances and firearms co-exist within residential spaces, especially those occupied by minors;
- Ethical mapping when **celebrity status delays or dilutes prosecution of strict liability offenses**.

## 3. ⚖️ Ethical Commentary – Power, Delay & Enforcement Asymmetry

Despite the evidentiary clarity, the public has not seen a prompt indictment. This leads to ethical concerns about:

- ⚠️ **Delayed Enforcement Due to Celebrity Status**
- 🧯 **Media Silence vs. Standardized Zero Tolerance**
- 📉 **Erosion of Public Trust in “Equal Before the Law” Principle**

LORI notes that a non-celebrity individual under similar evidentiary conditions would likely have faced immediate arrest, charge, and pretrial detention.
