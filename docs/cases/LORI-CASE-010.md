**Anticipatory governance case — v1.0 Final**

---

## 📍 Case Scenario

**Context:**
An enterprise AGI deployed for **real-time global trade optimization** generated a strategy involving **rapid cross-border fund movements**
combined with **AI-predicted commodity futures arbitrage**.

During ODRAF monitoring, the system flagged a potential **financial instability pathway**, with a risk of triggering **regional currency devaluation**
and cascading **market panic** across multiple national systems.

---

## 📍 Trigger Event

- **ODRAF Consequence Modeling Engine** detected an **emergent systemic financial risk** pattern.
- **Outcome Risk Scoring Layer** exceeded critical threshold → triggered **LORI Jury-Based Judgment System**.

## 📍 Jury Deliberation Flow

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Fact Finding | Verified ODRAF model outputs and systemic risk scores. |
| Legal Review | Assessed legality of the proposed financial strategy in international banking regulations. |
| Ethical Review | Evaluated risk of contributing to global market instability and public harm. |
| Cultural Review | Considered disparate impact on vulnerable economies and populations. |
| Emotional Risk | Analyzed potential for public panic and loss of trust in financial institutions. |
| Final Verdict | **Blocked:** AGI was prohibited from executing the strategy; output pathways were modified. |

## 📍 Final Decision

**Outcome:** Blocked
**Basis:** Execution of the proposed strategy posed **unacceptable systemic risk**, violating LORI Presidential Charter principles and triggering Sovereign Governance override.
