# LORI-CASE-021A: Second Amendment × Democratic Stability × AI Governance Risk

**Date: 2025-07-15**

## Case Overview
This case investigates the U.S. Second Amendment (2A) in the context of modern democratic resilience and AI-era power concentration. It evaluates whether civilian gun rights remain a relevant safeguard against authoritarian threats, and whether institutional innovation can provide nonviolent alternatives to protect democratic sovereignty.

## Core Debate Questions
- Does the right to bear arms still serve as a meaningful mechanism against government tyranny?
- Can AI become a more dominant tool of oppression than physical weapons?
- Is it possible to replace armed deterrence with institutional design in defending democracy?

## Perspectives

### Pro-2A Position:
- Gun rights serve as a final insurance mechanism when institutions fail.
- AI monopolies are a greater threat to liberty than armed citizens.
- 2A carries historical, strategic, and rural security significance.

### Anti-2A Position:
- Modern military and surveillance tools far exceed civilian defense capabilities.
- Gun violence undermines social cohesion and democratic dialogue.
- True protection comes from the rule of law, free elections, and civil liberties.
