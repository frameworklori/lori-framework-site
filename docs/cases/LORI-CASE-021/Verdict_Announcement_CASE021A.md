# Verdict Announcement – CASE021A

**Date of Deliberation: 2025-07-15**

## Final Verdict: 4 vs 3 – Conditional Support for 2A as a Sovereign Safeguard

### Majority Position (4 jurors):
- Acknowledged that in the absence of fully democratized AI infrastructure, civilians must retain minimal physical capacity to resist oppression.
- Framed 2A not as a call for violence, but as a pressure release valve for systemic failure.

### Minority Position (3 jurors):
- Emphasized the overwhelming societal harm caused by gun proliferation.
- Advocated for nonviolent institutional alternatives and AI-based civic oversight.

### Notes:
This verdict includes a recommendation to periodically reassess 2A’s function in society, depending on progress in open-source AI governance and democratic trust metrics.
