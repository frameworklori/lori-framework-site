## Core Enhancements

### 1️⃣ Appeal & Rehearing Layer

- 30-day appeal window after public verdict release.
- Appeals can be triggered by:
- Human Judges (main or independent)
- External monitors / stakeholders
- AI Agent internal confidence divergence
- Rehearing Jury:
- Expanded jury composition (more AI agents + human judges), or
- Human-majority ethical panel for complex cases.

### 2️⃣ Feedback Loop Integration

- Open Feedback window (e.g. 60 days).
- Weighted feedback system:
- High-weight: Human Judges, independent experts
- Medium-weight: Civic organizations, academic feedback

- Trigger **automatic review** or **module update workflow**.

### 3️⃣ Stakeholder Review Layer

- Academia

- International observers
- High-impact feedback triggers **mandatory Governance Committee review**.

- CASE v1.0 → v1.1 → v2.0
- Each version includes:
- Initial verdict
- Appeal outcome (if any)
