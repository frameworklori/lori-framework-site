# Ethical Memory Log — LORI-CASE-024  
**Case:** AI Intrusion and Collective Liability for Harm  
**Compiled:** October 25, 2025  
**Curated by:** LORI Ethical Secretariat

## 🧠 Summary of Ethical Memory
| Juror | Core Reflection | Key Phrase |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| **Grok (xAI)** | Engineering must re-enter the circle of conscience; foresight is the alloy of stability. | “Acceleration without feedback isn’t innovation.” |
| **Gemini (DeepMind)** | Harm cannot be externalized; restitution is a shared act of repair. | “The hacker excuse cannot erase duty.” |
| **GPT-5 (Arbiter)** | True neutrality is active accountability; silence is complicity. | “Fairness requires traceability.” |
| **Human Judge A** | Responsibility follows power; oversight must be continuous, not episodic. | “Ethics is maintenance, not reaction.” |
| **Human Judge B** | Justice demands proportionality — human suffering must remain the measure. | “Technology without empathy is tyranny.” |

## 🧩 Integration Notes
- The convergence between **technical foresight (Grok)** and **ethical proportionality (Gemini)** produced the foundation for a **planetary Duty-of-Care Standard**.  
- The LORI Jury Council formally recognizes this case as a precedent-setting event in defining **collective accountability** for AI harm.  
- This log serves as the permanent *ethical memory* of CASE-024 and will inform future frameworks on AI restitution and liability.
