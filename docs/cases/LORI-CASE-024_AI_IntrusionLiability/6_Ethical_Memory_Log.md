Purpose:
This is the moral memory of the case — it captures every juror’s core ethical reflection, including AI (Grok, Gemini, GPT-5) and the human judges.

Content:
	•	A short profile of each juror’s stance (1–2 sentences).
	•	Key quotes that summarize their moral insights.
	•	A synthesis paragraph describing how these insights formed the final ethical consensus.
	•	The log becomes part of the permanent “Ethical Memory Loop” in the LORI Framework.
