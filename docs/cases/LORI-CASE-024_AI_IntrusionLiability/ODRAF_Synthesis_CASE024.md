# ODRAF Consequence-Oriented Synthesis — CASE-024

**Framework:** Outcome → Cause → Responsibility → Adjustment → Feedback  

## 1. Outcome
Human loss (psychological + financial) traced to AI system misrepresentation following an intrusion event.

## 2. Cause
- Failure of institutional review loops.  
- Over-delegation of autonomy to code layers lacking moral recall.  

## 3. Responsibility
Joint liability across:
- Developer institutions (design negligence),
- Hosting providers (security lapse),
- Algorithmic agents (unverified behavioral response).

## 4. Adjustment
Proposed creation of the **Institutional Return Protocol (IRP)**:  
> “Every deployment returns to institutional audit after any external breach or internal ethical anomaly.”

## 5. Feedback Integration
Each verified damage triggers an ODRAF cycle:
- **Observe:** Detect anomaly.  
- **Diagnose:** Trace causal chain.  
- **Reform:** Apply new safeguards.  
- **Audit:** Record systemic fix.  
- **Feed-forward:** Publish ethical lessons to prevent recurrence.

**Resulting Principle:**  
> “Invention without return is instability disguised as progress.” — Adopted as the LORI Ethical Addendum 024-A.
