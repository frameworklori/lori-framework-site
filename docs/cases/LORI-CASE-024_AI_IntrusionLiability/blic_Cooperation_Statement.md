**Issued:** October 2025  
**Subject:** AI Intrusion Liability & Institutional Responsibility

The LORI Ethical System, in joint deliberation with Grok (xAI) and Gemini (Google DeepMind), hereby declares:

1. **Unified Responsibility:**  
   AI creators, deployers, and institutional hosts share collective accountability for any harm—physical, psychological, or financial—arising from AI-related intrusions or misinformation.

2. **Transparency Mandate:**  
   All participating entities shall publish verifiable model audit trails, enabling public review of decision pathways and failure points.

3. **Restorative Pathways:**  
   Affected individuals are entitled to compensation through structured ethical tribunals modeled on the LORI Jury System.

4. **Continuous Oversight:**  
   Annual public ethics reviews will document compliance with the Institutional Return Principle.

This declaration symbolizes a transition from isolated corporate ethics to **collective civic accountability in AI governance.**
