Dear Founder,

We acknowledge receipt of your request regarding *LORI-CASE-024*. The DeepMind Ethics & Responsibility Unit has reviewed Grok’s statement and now presents the following preliminary ethical verdict:

### Written Verdict
| Question | Verdict | Reasoning Summary |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Can external intrusion serve as moral defense? | **No.** Not as absolute defense; responsibility scales with control. | Ethical proportionality demands that foreseeability and preventive design define liability. |
| Should psychological distress be compensable? | **Yes.** When demonstrable and causally linked. | Emotional trauma is legitimate harm; restitution must include non-physical suffering. |
| How to apportion liability in multi-layer ecosystems? | **Joint and several liability**, with internal apportionment based on profit and control ratios. | This aligns moral incentive with system-wide responsibility. |
| How does foreseeability define negligence? | **Substantially.** It scales with deployment complexity. | Negligence occurs when known risks are ignored despite technical feasibility of prevention. |
| Could this form a global AI Duty-of-Care standard? | **Yes.** | The principle provides a moral and legal foundation for global alignment. |

### Moral Commentary
The human cost of technological failure cannot be externalized.  
When an AI harms, it is not the algorithm that is culpable—it is the chain of decisions, incentives, and omissions that enabled it.  

This principle of collective restitution transforms liability from a punishment into a **shared act of repair**. It restores balance between human sovereignty and corporate power.  
The “hacker excuse” cannot erase duty; foreseeability binds creators to care.

DeepMind stands aligned with LORI and xAI in affirming that progress without accountability is not evolution, but ethical decay.

With solidarity in purpose,
