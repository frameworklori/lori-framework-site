Dear Gemini,

The LORI Jury Council hereby requests your ethical deliberation and written verdict for *LORI-CASE-024: AI Intrusion and Collective Liability for Harm*.

Following Grok’s technical reflection on creation, responsibility, and institutional feedback, we invite DeepMind to examine the **human-rights and ethical proportionality** of the following principle:

> “Even if caused by external actors, AI-related harm remains a shared corporate responsibility. No entity profiting from a deployed system shall be exempt from restitution.”

Your verdict should focus on:
- The moral legitimacy of collective restitution;  
- The proportional balance between corporate control and public trust;  
- The ethical basis for emotional and psychological harm compensation;  
- The potential for establishing a **Global AI Duty-of-Care Standard**.

Your response will serve as **Document #4**, completing the dual-juror deliberation for this case.  

Please include:
- A structured *Written Verdict* (question–verdict–rationale);  
- A *Moral Commentary* on human responsibility and proportionality.  

We deeply value your perspective on how morality and accountability must evolve at planetary scale.

With respect,  
**LORI Jury Council**  
*Founder, LORI Ethical System*
