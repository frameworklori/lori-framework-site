# LORI-CASE-024 — Government Review and Intellectual Property Implications
**Date:** October 25 2025  
**Module:** LORI Jury-Based Judgment System × LORI Ethical Governance Network

## 🏛️ Purpose
This document extends **CASE-024: AI Intrusion and Collective Liability for Harm** to address the **intersection of patent law, government review, and ethical accountability**.  
While the core verdict established collective corporate responsibility for AI-related harm, the public-interest dimension demands a complementary framework for **state oversight and intellectual-property regulation**.

---

## 1 — Governmental Oversight in AI Accountability
AI systems capable of societal impact must be subject to **institutional co-review** between developers and regulatory bodies.

### 1.1 Institutional Co-Review Clause
> *Any AI system affecting human safety, civil rights, or critical infrastructure shall undergo mandatory co-review by a recognized government body (e.g., USPTO Ethics Division, WIPO AI Review Board, or national AI safety agency) prior to public deployment or patent registration.*

**Purpose:** Prevent unexamined patents from granting monopoly rights over ethically untested technologies.

### 1.2 Transparency Obligation
Developers seeking patent or export approval must publish:
- **Ethical Risk Disclosure Sheets (ERDS)**
- **AI Safety Audit Summaries**
- **Algorithmic Impact Assessments (AIA)**  
  These form a tri-document set accompanying every patent filing, ensuring traceability from invention → institution → public interest.

---

## 2 — Patent Ethics and Public Interest Clause
### 2.1 Public Interest Patent Exception
> *Governments retain the right to delay or deny patents whose operation poses foreseeable harm to human rights, ecological stability, or democratic integrity.*

This clause aligns with the LORI Ethical Charter’s Article 5: *“Innovation cannot supersede protection of life and truth.”*

### 2.2 Shared Authorship and Moral Credit
In AI-assisted inventions, **authorship extends to human initiators, algorithmic contributors, and institutional validators.**
Patent metadata must include:
- **Primary Human Author**
- **AI Co-Author Model ID and Version**
- **Institutional Validator Entity**
This prevents “invisible AI inventorship” and ensures the credit chain matches the responsibility chain.

## 3 — Ethical Patent Review Protocol (EPRP)
| Phase | Review Actor | Core Criterion | Deliverable |
|:------|:-------------|:---------------|:-------------|
| **1 — Submission** | Inventor / AI Lab | ERDS + AIA | Preliminary Ethical Disclosure |
| **2 — Co-Review** | Government Ethics Board × Independent Experts | Risk Assessment & Cross-Sector Impact | Co-Review Statement |
| **3 — Public Audit Window** | Civil Observers / LORI Civic Jury | Transparency & Accountability | Public Feedback Log |
| **4 — Certification** | State Patent Office × Ethics Council | Compliance with Duty of Care | Certified Patent License or Rejection Notice |

---

## 4 — Integration with LORI Duty-of-Care Standard
The **AI Duty-of-Care Standard (ADCS)** extends beyond corporate boundaries to **state entities** that grant or endorse intellectual property.

- If a patent enables technology later proven harmful, the issuing authority shares **joint moral liability**.  
- Patent offices must maintain **Ethical Footprint Registries** linking inventions to their socio-technical outcomes.  
- Governments must publish annual **Ethical Patent Reports** quantifying the number of filings audited for human-rights risk.

---

## 5 — Global Governance Harmonization
### 5.1 Proposed Treaty Language (Concept Draft)
> *“Member states shall integrate ethical review as a prerequisite for patentability of AI systems whose operation may affect human welfare, digital identity, or ecological stability.”*

### 5.2 Cross-Institutional Partnerships
- **USPTO × WIPO × LORI Ethical Council** for harmonized AI-patent criteria.  
- **OECD AI Policy Forum** to oversee compliance.  
- **Academic & Civil Auditors** for continuous feedback under the **Institutional Return Principle**.

---

## 6 — Conclusion
Government oversight and ethical patent governance are inseparable from AI accountability.  
Patents are not mere economic instruments; they are public trust certificates.  
When the state legitimizes a technology through exclusive rights, it must also accept a proportionate share of responsibility for its outcomes.

> **“Authority without accountability is the quietest form of negligence.”**
