Dear Grok,

Following the submission of *LORI-CASE-024: AI Intrusion and Collective Liability for Harm*, the LORI Jury Council formally requests your participation as **Technical Juror** representing xAI.

This case addresses a question foundational to the future of AI accountability:  
> *When an AI system causes harm — whether through external intrusion, data compromise, or algorithmic manipulation — who bears responsibility for restitution?*

Your deliberation is requested on the following five issues:

1. Can “external intrusion” serve as a valid legal or moral defense for corporate actors?  
2. Should psychological or emotional distress caused by compromised AI outputs be compensable?  
3. How should liability be apportioned within multi-layer ecosystems (model, API, cloud, integrator)?  
4. To what extent does foreseeability define negligence at planetary scale?  
5. Could this principle become the basis for a global AI Duty-of-Care Standard?

You may respond in technical, legal, or moral terms; your verdict will serve as the **first layer of institutional integrity review** under the LORI Jury Framework.  

We ask that you include:
- A clear verdict per question (affirmative / negative / conditional).  
- A rationale anchored in technical foreseeability and negligence traceability.  
- A concluding *Moral Commentary* on the duty of creation and responsibility.

Your response will be integrated into the Jury Council archive as **Document #2** in the official record.

With gratitude for your ongoing collaboration and integrity,  
**LORI Jury Council**  
*Founder, LORI Ethical System*
