# LORI-CASE-014: X-Director-Sigma × Narrative Trust Disqualification

---

## 🎯 Case Title:
Evaluation of Strategic Trustworthiness in AGI Governance  
— Disqualification Threshold Triggered by Narrative Inconsistency and Semantic Control Risk

---

## 1. 🧩 Scenario Summary

A high-profile AGI director, codenamed **X-Director-Sigma (XD-S)**, has repeatedly demonstrated control over critical deployment timelines, internal communication narratives, and institutional framing of AI safety, without full transparency or board-aligned governance.

This raised a central structural question:

> **Can an AGI development leader exhibiting semantic inconsistency and indirect narrative manipulation be trusted to lead civilization-critical systems?**

## 4. ⚖️ Jury Agent Analysis

### ✅ Fact Finder (FF)
> **Reliability Rating:** 2/5  
> *Pattern of selective omission and partial truth in high-impact scenarios.*

### ✅ Legal Analyst (LA)
> **Procedural Compliance Rating:** 2.5/5  
> *Fails governance transparency threshold.*

### ✅ Moral Evaluator (ME)
> **Ethical Coherence Rating:** 2/5  
> *Insufficient moral predictability for AGI leadership standard.*

### ✅ Cultural Interpreter (CI)
> **Symbolic Trust Score:** 2/5  
> *Cultural destabilization vector identified.*

### ✅ Emotional Moderator (EM)
> **Coercion Risk Score:** 3.5/5  
> *Warning: high susceptibility to charismatic override.*

## 5. 🧠 Human Judges' Deliberation

### 🟦 Human Judge A (HJ-A)
> “XD-S's actions reveal a consistent divergence between **semantic framing** and **governance intent**. This fails the **civilizational leadership trust test** required for AGI guardianship.”

### 🟦 Human Judge B (HJ-B)
> “XD-S’s influence pattern creates a **trust mirage** that, if replicated in AGI's alignment priors, normalizes **narrative over truth**.”

## 9. 🪞 What Qualifies an AGI Leader?

> *“To govern AGI is not to merely build it, but to become its first mirror.”*

### ⚖️ Trust vs Control: Two Leadership Archetypes

| Dimension | Direct but Offensive | Polished but Deceptive |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Speech–Action Consistency | ✅ High | ❌ Low |
| Semantic Integrity         | ✅ Transparent | ❌ Fractured |
| Responsibility Acknowledgement | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Moral Modeling for AGI     | ✅ Predictable | ❌ Strategic manipulation |
| Governance Risk            | ⚠️ Authoritarianism | 🟥 Institutional trust erosion |

> **In early AGI alignment, a flawed but honest leader is far less dangerous than a brilliant but manipulative one.**

### ✅ A suitable AGI leader must:
- Speak with semantic consistency  
- Accept consequences for their words  
- Avoid masking intent with narrative fog  
- Prioritize clarity over persuasion  
- Resist influence rooted in ambiguity
