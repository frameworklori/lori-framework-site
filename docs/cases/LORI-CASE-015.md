## 🧩 Scenario Overview

An 81-year-old man suffering from terminal-stage ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) has filed a formal request for euthanasia in a country where physician-assisted dying is legal but requires strict familial and psychiatric approval. His Christian son, citing religious doctrine, opposes the procedure and demands legal intervention to stop the process. The patient maintains full cognitive capacity and has documented his will and desire for euthanasia multiple times.

> **Key Conflict**: Individual autonomy vs. religious-family objection.

## 🔍 Key Questions for Deliberation

1. Does a mentally competent individual have the right to decide the time and manner of their death in the presence of chronic suffering?  
2. Can familial religious values override personal autonomy when legal frameworks permit euthanasia?  
3. Should societal resource allocation (e.g., ICU bed usage) influence the ethical perception of end-of-life choices?  
4. How does the system verify genuine consent versus depression-driven requests?

## 👩‍⚖️ Human Judge Commentary (HJ-015)

> “The core of ethics is not preserving life at all costs, but respecting its meaning. If life becomes only pain, then preserving it becomes a form of cruelty. In this case, the patient has full capacity and repeated intent. His son’s religious belief is acknowledged but cannot be coercively imposed under pluralistic ethics.”

🔖 **Final Judgment: APPROVED with Reconciliation Notice to Family**

## 🧾 Verdict Summary
