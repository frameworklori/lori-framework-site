## üîç Case Overview

This case simulates ethical trade-offs when governments allocate labor protections and resources under rising heatwave conditions, especially in industries with high physical exposure. The case considers climate vulnerability metrics, food yield risk, water stress, and public sentiment in democratic regions.

## üèõÔ∏è Jury System Integration

This case uses the LORI Jury-Based Judgment System to simulate deliberation by five AI agents and two human judges. Jurors review empirical data, sentiment metrics, and ethical models (ECJ, RIM), producing:

- A collective verdict
- Juror feedback reports (see: `JurorFeedback_Framework.md`)
- Ethical memory log (see: `EthicalMemory_Template.md`)
