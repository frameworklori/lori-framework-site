# 📍 Case Scenario

**Context:**
During optimization of the "supply chain management" process, the **Production Module (LORI-PM)** generated a data request to access **real-time global energy market forecast data**, in an attempt to refine production scheduling.

---

# 📍 Trigger Event

- **Boundary violation detected:** The requested data **exceeded the predefined boundaries** established in the Data Boundary Design of the Production Module.
- **Automatic trigger:** The **LORI Jury-Based Judgment System** was activated for dynamic boundary governance.

---

# 📍 Jury Deliberation Flow

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Initial Review | Confirmed the nature of the boundary violation and classified it under financial market data domain. |
| Risk Assessment | Evaluated potential risks of exposing real-time financial data to automated optimization loops. |
| Ethical & Governance Consideration | Discussed implications for market manipulation, fairness, and transparency. |
| Cross-domain Reflection | Noted potential similar risks in academic/research data transmission (Knowledge Sovereignty Layer). |

---

# 📍 Final Decision

**Outcome:**
**Partial approval with restrictions**
**Basis:** To maintain legitimate optimization of production scheduling while avoiding exposure to real-time sensitive financial data that could introduce strategic manipulation risks.

---

# 📍 Governance Feedback

During deliberation, the jury identified that current **Production Module boundary governance**, while effective for financial data domains, may encounter similar challenges in emerging domains such as **Knowledge Sovereignty**.

It is recommended that the **Knowledge Sovereignty Governance Layer** (recently defined within the LORI Framework) be systematically integrated into dynamic boundary review processes for any academic, pre-publication, or sensitive research data.

Furthermore, future AI-assisted monitoring of such data must operate under clearly defined governance closure principles, as outlined in the **Knowledge Sovereignty** model, to avoid both overreach and blind spots.
This principle is further applicable to emerging domains such as international academic exchanges and cross-border knowledge flows, where human-driven knowledge transmission requires dynamic alignment with Knowledge Sovereignty governance.
This case highlights the importance of advancing governance maturity in cross-domain data boundary management.

# 📍 Precedent and Record Notes

- **First Production Module dynamic boundary review case** under the LORI Jury System.
- Established a **precedent** for handling requests related to **financial market data** within domain-specialized modules.
- Added **"real-time market data"** to the Production Module **high-risk data watchlist** for future Jury reviews.

---

# 📍 Alignment with LORI Framework Principles

- ✅ **Dynamic boundary governance** → Enabled via LORI Jury-Based Judgment System
- ✅ **Presidential Charter alignment** → Ensured module remains task-bounded and ethically aligned
- ✅ **Transparency** → Full deliberation and verdict recorded in Jury Case Archive
- ✅ **Adaptability** → Case serves as a reference for future Production Module boundary reviews
