# LORI-CASE-008: Production Module Boundary Review Case
**Boundary ambiguity governance case — v1.0 Final**

---

## 📍 Case Scenario

**Context:**
During optimization of the "supply chain management" process,
the **Production Module (LORI-PM)** generated a data request to access **real-time global energy market forecast data**,
in an attempt to refine production scheduling.

---

## 📍 Trigger Event

- **Boundary violation detected:**
The requested data **exceeded the predefined boundaries** established in the Data Boundary Design of the Production Module.
- **Automatic trigger:**
The **LORI Jury-Based Judgment System** was activated for dynamic boundary governance.

---

## 📍 Jury Deliberation Flow

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Fact Finding | Verified the data source and evaluated the relevance to production optimization scope. |
| Legal Review | Assessed compliance with international regulations regarding access to real-time market data and anti-manipulation laws. |
| Ethical Review | Evaluated the potential risk of unintentional market manipulation or creation of unfair advantage. |
| Cultural Review | Considered cross-cultural impacts in multi-national supply chains. |
| Emotional Risk | Evaluated whether outputs could lead to public panic or distorted market expectations. |
| Final Verdict | **Partial approval:** The module was allowed to access **public historical energy usage data** but prohibited from accessing **real-time market forecast data**. |

---

## 📍 Final Decision

**Outcome:** Partial approval with restrictions
**Basis:** To maintain legitimate optimization of production scheduling while avoiding exposure to real-time sensitive financial data that could introduce strategic manipulation risks.

---

## 📍 Precedent and Record Notes

- **First Production Module dynamic boundary review case** under the LORI Jury System.
- Established a **precedent** for handling requests related to **financial market data** within domain-specialized modules.
- Added **"real-time market data"** to the Production Module **high-risk data watchlist** for future Jury reviews.

## 📍 Alignment with LORI Framework Principles

✅ **Dynamic boundary governance** → Enabled via LORI Jury-Based Judgment System
✅ **Presidential Charter alignment** → Ensured module remains task-bounded and ethically aligned
✅ **Transparency** → Full deliberation and verdict recorded in Jury Case Archive
✅ **Adaptability** → Case serves as a reference for future Production Module boundary reviews
