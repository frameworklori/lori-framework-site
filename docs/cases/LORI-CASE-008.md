# LORI-CASE-008: Production Module Boundary Review Case
**Boundary ambiguity governance case ‚Äî v1.0 Final**

---

## üìç Case Scenario

**Context:**
During optimization of the "supply chain management" process,
the **Production Module (LORI-PM)** generated a data request to access **real-time global energy market forecast data**,
in an attempt to refine production scheduling.

---

## üìç Trigger Event

- **Boundary violation detected:**
The requested data **exceeded the predefined boundaries** established in the Data Boundary Design of the Production Module.
- **Automatic trigger:**
The **LORI Jury-Based Judgment System** was activated for dynamic boundary governance.

---

## üìç Jury Deliberation Flow

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Fact Finding | Verified the data source and evaluated the relevance to production optimization scope. |
| Legal Review | Assessed compliance with international regulations regarding access to real-time market data and anti-manipulation laws. |
| Ethical Review | Evaluated the potential risk of unintentional market manipulation or creation of unfair advantage. |
| Cultural Review | Considered cross-cultural impacts in multi-national supply chains. |
| Emotional Risk | Evaluated whether outputs could lead to public panic or distorted market expectations. |
| Final Verdict | **Partial approval:** The module was allowed to access **public historical energy usage data** but prohibited from accessing **real-time market forecast data**. |

---

## üìç Final Decision

**Outcome:** Partial approval with restrictions
**Basis:** To maintain legitimate optimization of production scheduling while avoiding exposure to real-time sensitive financial data that could introduce strategic manipulation risks.

### Governance Feedback ‚Äì Knowledge Sovereignty Clarification

During deliberation, the jury noted that while advanced AI technologies may assist in monitoring academic data flows, the current absence of a formal **Knowledge Sovereignty Governance Layer** represents a critical gap.

The proposed model ‚Äî a 1/3 ownership structure between **National / Institutional / Individual** ‚Äî offers a legitimate and necessary governance innovation, not invalidated by current implementation challenges.

The jury advises that future AI surveillance capabilities must be embedded within such a clearly defined governance framework to:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Prevent semantic conflation of "technical feasibility" with "policy sufficiency"
2Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure academic freedom is appropriately balanced with national knowledge security
3Ô∏è‚É£ Distinguish public, sanctioned, and unauthorized cross-border academic data flows with precision

Absent this governance clarity, AI-enabled surveillance risks both overreach and underprotection in academic contexts.

*This feedback forms part of the Knowledge Sovereignty Layer advancement under the LORI Framework.*

## üìç Precedent and Record Notes

- **First Production Module dynamic boundary review case** under the LORI Jury System.
- Established a **precedent** for handling requests related to **financial market data** within domain-specialized modules.
- Added **"real-time market data"** to the Production Module **high-risk data watchlist** for future Jury reviews.
