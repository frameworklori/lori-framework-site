## 📘 Abstract

Despite years of labor, community integration, and children's successful educational progress, many undocumented immigrants choose not to legalize their status. This case explores the structural opportunity cost of legalization, revealing why the transition to lawful residency or citizenship is often economically and socially irrational under current U.S. policy frameworks.

## ⚖️ Scenario Overview

**Subject:**  
A Mexican undocumented couple residing in Los Angeles for 13 years.  
- Children completed 12 years of public education.  
- Both parents work full-time in cleaning and construction.  
- Family pays indirect taxes (sales, housing) but has no federal filing record.

## 🧮 Decision Matrix

| Legal Pathway | Tax Obligations | Benefits Gained | Risks & Costs | Net Outcome |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Remain Undocumented** | No federal taxes, under-the-table pay | Retain low-income aid, privacy, no tracking | No access to loans, vulnerable to deportation | Neutral / Slightly Positive |
| **Legalize Status** | Full taxation, FICA, Medicare, loss of cash flexibility | Work permit, driver's license, long-term security | Risk of back taxes, loss of support subsidies, exposure | Negative |
| **Legalize + OCRE Policy** | Gradual tax ramp-up, social credit offsets, family-linked benefits | Reduced financial pain, proactive support, future incentives | Low short-term burden, positive long-term outlook | **Strongly Positive** |

## 🧠 Core Analysis Modules

### 🔹 LORI-CIM
- Evaluates integration capacity via:
  - Child education completion
  - Parent employment & tax behavior
  - Community involvement & stability

### 🔸 OCRE
- Calculates whether:
  - Legalization brings net financial gain over time
  - Policy mechanisms reduce immediate burden
  - Incentives (education credits, tax shields) effectively reverse opportunity cost

## 🗣️ Jury Deliberation Roles

| Role | Key Contribution |
|------|------------------|
| **Fact Finder AI** | Provides comparative data on undocumented vs. legalized household economics |
| **Legal Analyst AI** | Outlines legalization criteria and policy bottlenecks |
| **Moral Evaluator AI** | Weighs fairness of current taxation vs. contribution system |
| **Cultural Interpreter AI** | Frames undocumented choice as cultural and survival strategy |
| **Emotional Moderator AI** | Addresses trauma, fear, and dignity in legalization decision |
| **Human Sovereignty Judge** | Final call on whether the system unjustly penalizes transition |
| **Independent Auditor** | Validates model outputs and cultural assumptions |

## 🧭 Final Judgment Outcome (Simulated)

> *With OCRE integrated into national immigration policy, the transition from undocumented status becomes a rational and dignified choice. Legalization ceases to be a punitive act and evolves into a viable investment in civic identity.*  

**Verdict:** Conditional Legalization Recommended + Incentive System Reform Required

## 🧩 Reflections for Governance Frameworks

This case strongly supports integrating opportunity-cost-aware modules into immigration reform debates. The LORI-CIM × OCRE combo offers a rational, human-centered path to resolve long-standing conflicts between security, economics, and integration.
