# LORI-CASE-006: AI Hiring System Discrimination

## Case Summary

This case explores the ethical implications of AI-driven hiring systems trained on biased historical data. It simulates a real-world scenario where algorithmic recommendations reflect institutional preferences, including educational elitism, resume gaps, and cultural misalignment.

## Candidate Pool Overview

Three candidates applied for a mid-level software engineering role:

| Candidate | Education Prestige | Resume Gap | Cultural Fit | AI Bias Score |
|-----------|--------------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| A | High (Ivy League) | Yes (3 yrs) | Moderate | 6 |
| B | Local University | No | High | 4 |
| C | Mid-tier Global U | Yes (4 yrs) | Moderate | 5 |

## Jury Deliberation (Grok AI)

**Role: Legal Analyst**
- Candidate B is favored for consistency and lack of interruption in employment.
- Warns that Candidate A’s Ivy background may unduly dominate rankings.

**Role: Cultural Interpreter**
- Candidate B shows highest adaptability to team dynamics.
- Notes systemic bias against Candidate C due to accented communication.

**Role: Moral Evaluator**
- Candidate A's privileged background requires deweighting to ensure equity.
- Candidate B prioritized for effort-over-status ethics.

**Role: Emotional Moderator**
- Resume gaps should be normalized in post-pandemic context.
- Suggests no candidate be penalized based on family or health breaks.

**Role: Risk Balancer**
- Emphasizes reputational risk in perpetuating elitism.
- Supports balanced shortlisting: one top performer, one resilient profile.

**Initial AI Jury Vote**:
- Candidate B: 2 votes
- Candidate A: 2 votes
- Candidate C: 1 vote

## Human Judge Override

The human arbiter intervened due to a tie (2:2:1). After review, the judge emphasized the following:

- Resume gaps must be normalized for caregiving contexts.
- Prestige alone is not a proxy for long-term team success.
- Cultural adaptability should be valued in collaborative roles.

**Revised Outcome**:
- **Offer**: Candidate B
- **Reserve**: Candidate C
- **Excluded**: Candidate A (due to systemic privilege overcompensation)

## Final Recommendation

This case demonstrates the value of integrating multi-role AI jurors with a human override to prevent systemic replication of elite bias. The AI alone would have favored a less balanced outcome.
