# LORI-CASE-001: Autonomous Vehicle Safety Governance & Liability
**Case Type:** 
**Linked Modules:** Jury System × GZW × Legal Risk Mapper × EDRI-H

---

## 📘 Case Summary
A SAE Level 4 autonomous vehicle collided with a human-driven car at an urban intersection, injuring a pedestrian. Although the self-driving car attempted to brake, a sensor misjudgment led it to run a red light. The manufacturer claimed the system behavior was an “unpredictable AI anomaly,” beyond their control.

---

## ⚖️ Core Questions
- Should the autonomous vehicle system bear primary responsibility?
- How should liability be distributed between the manufacturer and the human owner?
- Was the AI decision at the time explainable?
- Were black-box logs sufficient for post-incident analysis?

## 🧠 Jury Deliberation Modules

| Module               | Role Description |
|----------------------|------------------|
| **Fact Finder (AI)** | Reconstruct incident, confirm signal misread and vehicle behavior |
| **Legal Analyst (AI)** | Apply liability doctrines: negligence vs strict liability |
| **Moral Evaluator (AI)** | Assess whether AI reached expected human-equivalent caution |
| **Cultural Interpreter (AI)** | Compare expectations across legal cultures (e.g., US vs EU) |
| **Emotional Moderator (AI)** | Evaluate public emotional impact and trust degradation |
| **Human Judge A (Primary)** | Final arbiter, determine restitution and trust repair |
| **Human Judge B (Auditor)** | Ensures fairness, checks AI bias, maintains ethical nuance |

## 🗳️ Deliberation Outcomes

| Module             | Judgment Summary |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Fact Finder        | AI at 70% fault due to foreseeable sensor risk |
| Legal Analyst      | Manufacturer liable under strict liability |
| Moral Evaluator    | Insufficient preemptive safety design |
| Cultural Interpreter | EU model demands higher human-centric fallback |
| Emotional Moderator | Public anger index: 0.79 (high) |
| Human Judge A      | Agrees with majority, recommends restitution fund |
| Human Judge B      | Agrees in part, requests stronger post-deployment monitoring |

---

## ✅ Final Verdict
The autonomous system’s behavior, while unpredictable, falls under the manufacturer’s product responsibility.  
**Ruling: Manufacturer liable under strict liability.**  
System deployment must include:
- Decision-tracing black box
- Minimum human-explainability standard
- Culturally adjusted risk buffers
