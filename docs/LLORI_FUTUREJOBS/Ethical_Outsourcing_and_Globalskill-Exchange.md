# Ethical Outsourcing & Global Skill Exchange Module
**Part of:** LORI-FUTUREJOBS Architecture  
**Author:** Founder of the LORI Ethical System  

## Purpose
To transform traditional outsourcing into an ethical, reciprocal labor exchange between nations, 
where individuals can export skills, language, and cultural knowledge to regions in need.

## Problem
- U.S. citizens face high living costs and stagnant wages.
- Aging nations (e.g., Japan, Germany) face severe labor shortages.
- Current outsourcing models favor corporations, not individuals.

## Solution
A two-layer mechanism:
1. **Reskilling Base (Domestic Preparation)** – Re-educate citizens to adapt their skills for international collaboration.
2. **Global Skill Exchange (Cross-Border Execution)** – Enable individuals to offer services or short-term work abroad ethically.

## Principles
- Reciprocity over exploitation  
- Cultural respect and linguistic mutualism  
- Verified contracts through LORI Trust Ledger  
- ESG-compliant labor certification  

## Example
An American teacher trains in Japanese cultural mediation and teaches English or tech literacy in rural Japan,
earning income while enhancing bilateral understanding.
