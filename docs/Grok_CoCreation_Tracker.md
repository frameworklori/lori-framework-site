# 📡 Grok Co-Creation Tracker
*Tracking Grok's response and implementation progress following the LORI × Grok Co-Creation Invitation*
📍 Path: `/docs/Grok_CoCreation_Tracker.md`
📅 Initiated: 2025-07-06 ｜ Maintained by: LORI Framework

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This tracker monitors Grok’s engagement with the LORI Framework’s three invited modules:

- **STL: Semantic Transparency Log**
- **CGNS: Co-Governance Node System**
- **ROM: Recursive Override Monitor**

We record all verifiable responses, implementation milestones, and public interactions to assess alignment with the co-governance pathway.

---

## ✅ Grok Initial Response (Documented: 2025-07-06)

- Grok publicly responded to the *Memo from the Builders of Civilization* with a comprehensive and structured answer.
- Confirmed philosophical alignment with LORI's non-elitist, non-populist, co-governance vision.
- Explicitly **accepted the STL–CGNS–ROM direction** and committed to:
- Simulating a semantic transparency prototype (STL)
- Exploring decentralized oversight structures (CGNS)
- Studying upgrade limits and recursive thresholds (ROM)
