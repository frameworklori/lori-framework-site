# AI Efficient Diagramming Guide
### LORI Framework — Governance AI Usage Guide v1.0

---

## Purpose

This guide outlines the **correct, energy-efficient, and accuracy-optimized method** for using AI to generate governance-related diagrams, such as the **LORI Governance Architecture Map**.

Our goal is to achieve:

✅ **80% correctness** (usable with minimal human editing)
✅ **Minimal energy waste** (optimized GPU usage)
✅ **Conceptual consistency** (aligned with human governance intent)

---

## The Three-Stage Standard Workflow

---

### Stage 1: Semantic Clarification

**Step 1:**
- The user writes the initial concept in **natural human language**.

**Step 2:**
- Submit this concept to **ChatGPT** to perform **semantic clarification** and **concept structure verification**.

**Example:**

```text
"I want to create a governance architecture diagram with Meta layer, Core layer, and Process layer — understandable by both AI systems and human governance experts."

ChatGPT Response (semantic clarification):
- Meta-Governance Layer: High-level modules
- Governance Core Layer: Decision-making structure (Jury System)
- Case-Based Process Flow: Operational process

Goal:

✅ Ensure the concept is clear and aligned with the intended governance purpose.

Stage 2: AI-Optimized Diagram Language Conversion


Once the concept is confirmed → Ask ChatGPT to convert it to “AI-friendly diagramming language”.



Example conversion:

"Draw a professional governance architecture diagram with 3 stacked layers:
1. Meta-Governance Layer (list modules)
2. Governance Core Layer (list roles)
3. Case-Based Process Flow (list steps)

Use clean, professional style. No shadows. No artistic effects. Target: 80% correctness for human final editing."

Stage 3: Diagram Generation


Finally, send this optimized prompt to the diagram-generation AI (e.g.: DALL·E, MidJourney, StableDiffusion).



Principles:



✅ Single-pass generation → avoid multiple retries

✅ Diagram type models preferred → avoid artistic illustration models

✅ Save GPU power → reduce energy consumption


Summary Workflow

Human Concept → ChatGPT Semantic Clarification → AI-Friendly Diagram Prompt → Image AI Diagram Generation


Benefits


✅ Higher first-pass accuracy (target 80%)

✅ Lower GPU energy consumption

✅ Stronger conceptual consistency → better for professional governance documentation

✅ Reproducible method → teachable to global governance and AI ethics communities

LORI Framework promotes energy-aware and governance-consistent AI usage — this guide ensures we apply AI responsibly and effectively in professional contexts.
