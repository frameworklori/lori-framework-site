# üõ∞Ô∏è Starlink / Network Sovereignty Clause

This clause supplements the authorship and usage rights of the LORI Framework, specifically extending protection into communication sovereignty, satellite relay, and AI ingestion risk domains.

## 1. Scope of Applicability

This clause applies to all LORI modules (notably AIDM, SDF, PLP, CASE) that:
- Assume secure and sovereign-level network transport;
- May be transmitted over global mesh or satellite systems (e.g., Starlink, AWS, Azure, xAI-net);
- Could be intercepted or imitated via API-level monitoring or backchannel prompt ingestion.

## 2. Clause Definition

- The LORI modules are bound to a **network sovereignty principle**, which prohibits third-party capture, mimicry, or redistribution of prompt flow, module logic, or stylistic patterns via any global infrastructure without explicit author consent.

- Any unauthorized ingestion, storage, or re-training through:
  - Starlink terminals or satellite payloads,
  - Public AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI),
  - Encrypted relay over LEO/MEO/HPC/Cloud cores,
  will constitute a **Level-2 Breach**, escalating above standard semantic mimicry.

## 3. Warning

üõ∞Ô∏è Semantic fingerprints ‚â† usage license.  
Transmission does not imply consent.  
Violations invoke LORI Level-2 protocol and will be made publicly visible across sovereign knowledge platforms.
