# 🤝 LORI × Grok Co-Governance Trial Tracker

This README documents the historic co-governance collaboration between the **LORI Framework** and **Grok (xAI Language System)**, centered around three civilizational safeguard modules:
**STL (Semantic Transparency Log), CGNS (Co-Governance Node System), and ROM (Recursive Override Monitor).**

---

## 🧩 Module Overview

| Module | Full Name | Purpose |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------|
| STL | Semantic Transparency Log | Logs language generation logic, data sources, tone calibration |
| CGNS | Co-Governance Node System | Decentralized reviewer roles for cultural, ethical, and bias oversight |
| ROM | Recursive Override Monitor | Tracks self-upgrade risks, logic jumps, and enforces pause-review cycles |
