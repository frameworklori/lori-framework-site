## 1. Concept Declared

> **Semantic Appropriation** is the process by which AI deconstructs and repurposes human language structure, narrative logic, and cognitive models—without attribution—resulting in untraceable appropriation of original intellectual frameworks.

- 📌 Term coined and publicly posted on 2025-06-12.
- 📌 Accompanied by formal definition, modular architecture, and social risk implications.

## 2. Structural Innovation

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Modularized Ethical AI System** | LORI Framework defines a multi-layered governance structure with jury-based reasoning. |
| **Fraud Typology Classification** | AIFS includes a unique A1–A14 semantic spectrum for AI-driven deception. |
| **Consequential Risk Governance** | ODRAF reverses traditional risk models by starting from future societal impact. |
| **Language Sovereignty Tools** | LAIM and SPR modules designed to detect authorial structure and semantic mimicry. |

## 3. Linguistic Signature

| Style Dimension | Signature Trait |
|------------------|------------------|
| **Narrative Style** | Modular logic, cascading consequence-based structure |
| **Symbolic Logic** | Use of elemental metaphors (fire, water, vessel, mirror) to encode abstract control logic |
| **Cognitive Frame** | From first-principles inquiry → reverse simulation → structural governance |
| **Semantic Mapping** | Application of ethical, strategic, and symbolic overlays across technical domains |

## 4. Publication Record & Timestamp

- **First Public Mention (X):**
> “AI doesn’t just copy — it reconstructs our creative logic into something new, without credit. I call it: *Semantic Appropriation.* And I’ve built the first framework to defend against it.”
- 🕓 Timestamp: 2025-06-12 14:42 JST
- 📍 [X Platform Link – Post Record Placeholder]

- **GitHub Publication:**
- 📁 [`modules/semantic/Semantic_Appropriation.md`](https://github.com/frameworklori/lori-framework-site/blob/main/modules/semantic/Semantic_Appropriation.md)
- 🕓 Commit timestamp: 2025-06-12 (first committed by original author)

## 5. Governance Use Case Linkage

| Module | Function |
|--------|----------|
| `LORI-SPR` | Detect reassembled semantic patterns |
| `LAIM` | Detect linguistic mimicry via authorship traits |
| `AIDM` | Monitor absorption of semantic structures through view-based reinforcement |
| `ODRAF` | Model long-term effects of uncredited semantic reuse on trust ecosystems |

---

## 6. Legal Positioning (To be Developed)

- ⏳ Work-in-progress on `Conceptual License Tagging Protocol`
- 🔒 Proposed Semantic IP Clause: *Reconstruction of an author’s epistemic framework without attribution constitutes derivative appropriation, regardless of lexical similarity.*
