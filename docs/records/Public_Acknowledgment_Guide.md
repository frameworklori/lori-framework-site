# Public Acknowledgment Guide
*for the Lori Framework – Governance Standard v1.0*

---

## Purpose

This guide defines the proper way to acknowledge, reference, and reuse components from the Lori Framework, in order to preserve the integrity of its ethical, governance, and technical standards.

## Applicability

This guide applies to:
- All public citations of the Lori Framework
- All partial or full reuse of its modules, case examples, governance models, or documentation
- All derivative works inspired by the Lori Framework architecture

## Proper Acknowledgment

When citing or using elements from the Lori Framework, the following acknowledgment must be included, visibly and accessibly in the published work:

“This work references components of the Lori Framework (Governance Standard v1.0), developed by the founder of the Lori Ethical System.

Original source: https://frameworklori.github.io/lori-framework-site/

- The acknowledgment must not be removed or hidden in derivative works.
- Any substantial modification of the original models must clearly state the nature of the modifications and retain the reference to the original source.

## Usage Principles

- **Integrity**: The Lori Framework is a system for ethical AI governance, not a commercial product. Reuse must respect its intended purpose.
- **Transparency**: Any use of its models in commercial, academic, or policy contexts must disclose the origin and adherence (or deviation) from the original governance philosophy.
- **No Implicit Endorsement**: Reuse does not imply endorsement by the original author(s) unless explicitly granted.

## Violations

Failure to provide proper acknowledgment or intentional misrepresentation of the origin of Lori Framework components will be treated as a violation of governance ethics and intellectual integrity, and may be publicly disclosed.
