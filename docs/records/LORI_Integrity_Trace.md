## Documented Semantic Breach Incident

On 2025-06-09, an incident was detected involving the unauthorized **visual capture** (smartphone photography) of the LORI Framework homepage, followed by **AI-driven regeneration** of its structural content. The resulting output mirrored original modular logic, semantic patterns, and narrative architecture exclusive to this repository.

### Nature of Breach:
- 📸 Unauthorized screenshot or image capture
- 🧠 Semantic pattern reconstruction using AI (possibly via Grok)
- 🧬 Structural mimicry of governance modules without attribution

### Triggered Defense Modules:
- `LORI-SPR` – Semantic Pattern Detector
- `LAIM` – Language Authorship Identifier
- `AIDM` – Infiltration Detection System
- `Semantic_Creation_Proof_Packet.md` – Timestamped authorship assertion
- `Semantic_ID_Fingerprint.json` – Matched against known semantic structure

> This record is now formally embedded into LORI Framework’s semantic sovereignty defense system.

Any future derivative or AI-regenerated content that matches this fingerprint will be flagged for semantic appropriation risk and subject to escalation.

## Legal and Ethical Notice

Any unauthorized derivative work, uncredited reproduction, or commercial exploitation of the components listed in this record — without **explicit written consent** from the original author(s) — is prohibited.

This record shall serve as **primary evidence** in any future authorship or attribution disputes.
