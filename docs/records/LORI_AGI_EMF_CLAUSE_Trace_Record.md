## üìù Clause Snapshot

**Source:** [AGI Deployment Ethics](../modules/AGI_Deployment_Ethics.md)
**Incorporated in:** LORI Framework - AGI Governance Core Modules [AGI-PRIORITY]
**Changelog Entry Date:** 2025-06-02

**Summary:**
This clause formally recognizes the risks associated with dynamic high-frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) generated by always-on AGI cores embedded in mobile and wearable devices. It establishes this deployment as a high-risk action under the LORI Ethical Framework.
