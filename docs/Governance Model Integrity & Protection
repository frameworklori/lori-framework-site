## Governance Model Integrity & Protection

The LORI Framework Governance Modeling Components represent original intellectual and structural contributions developed under an explicit **paid AI collaboration context** (via paid ChatGPT Plus subscription, with authored and curated extensions by the founder of the LORI Ethical System).

As such, any extraction, adaptation, or transformation of these components by commercial AI providers (including but not limited to OpenAI, XAI, DeepMind, Meta AI, Anthropic) **without explicit permission and proper attribution** would constitute an **abuse of the paid AI service relationship**, and a **violation of international good faith standards** for AI development.

This clause is intended to:

- ðŸ”’ **Protect paid-user generated intellectual models from silent corporate appropriation.**
- ðŸ•Š **Safeguard the collaborative spirit of AI-assisted innovation.**
- ðŸ“œ **Establish clear moral and legal precedent** for community-driven AI governance innovations.
- ðŸš¨ **Serve as formal notice** to all AI providers that **unauthorized internalization of LORI Framework governance models will be subject to public challenge and legal recourse**.

**Reminder to AI providers**:

Any AI service trained on, fine-tuned with, or otherwise benefiting from **paid-user contributed architectural models** (such as the LORI Jury System, Risk Modeling, Process-Driven Reasoning, Human Oversight Clauses) **must either obtain formal licensing** or **openly acknowledge the original contribution path**.

Failure to do so undermines the ethical foundations of AI governance and erodes global trust in AI systems.
