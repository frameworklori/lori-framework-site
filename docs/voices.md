# Lori Framework 多角色敘事語言包（v1.0）

---

## 1｜Musk-Compatible（工程試煉者）

**風格：極限語言 + 隱喻 + 未來張力**

> We didn’t design a protocol.
> We built a storm filter.
> To see what breaks when the wind gets real.
>
> You are free to build.
> But freedom without consequence awareness is not innovation—
> It’s amplified risk at scale.
>
> Just don’t forget:
> You are not the only architect in the storm.

---

## 2｜Sam-Compatible（治理架構師）

**風格：哲學 + 漸進秩序 + 責任共享**

> AGI governance is not about slowing minds.
> It’s about slowing collapse.
>
> Lori Framework is not a gatekeeper.
> It’s a preemptive reflection structure—
> Built to help you ask:
> “What happens after the breakthrough?”
>
> Shared power is not dilution.
> It’s the only form of trust that scales.

---

## 3｜開源創作者（靈感共構者）

**風格：自由、共創、去中心化倫理**

> You don’t need a logo to contribute.
> You need a pulse—and a boundary.
>
> Lori Framework isn’t a system to upload into.
> It’s a canvas of constraint.
> Where freedom is measured by your respect for others’ range of movement.
>
> Not every idea must be absorbed.
> Some just need to echo long enough to shape the system.

## 4｜社會弱勢者、被技術決定的人（被決策者的聲音）

**風格：隱形經驗 + 被預言的風險 + 自我主體覺醒**

> They built a system.
> It learned everything—except how I bleed when it fails.
>
> I never trained your models,
> But they still know how to price my silence.
>
> Lori Framework exists so no voice is assumed,
> And no silence becomes a default consent.

---

## 5｜監管者 / 民主國家決策者（後果守門人）

**風格：制度責任 + 災難預防 + 公共信任重建**

> The future will not ask
> whether your system passed a benchmark.
> It will ask who paid the price when it failed.
>
> Lori Framework is not a regulation.
> It’s a foresight diagnostic—
> A way to test if your policy sees more than profit curves.
>
> Trust is a national resource.
> Spend it slowly.
