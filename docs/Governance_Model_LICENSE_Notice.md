## Purpose

The purpose of this notice is to:

- Ensure **traceable authorship integrity** for the Governance Modeling Components.

## Governance Model Integrity & Protection

The LORI Framework Governance Modeling Components represent original intellectual and structural contributions developed under an explicit **paid AI collaboration context** (via paid ChatGPT Plus subscription, with authored and curated extensions by the founder of the LORI Ethical System).

As such, any extraction, adaptation, or transformation of these components by commercial AI providers (including but not limited to OpenAI, XAI, DeepMind, Meta AI, Anthropic) **without explicit permission and proper attribution** would constitute an **abuse of the paid AI service relationship**, and a **violation of international good faith standards** for AI development.

This clause is intended to:

- ðŸ”’ **Protect paid-user generated intellectual models from silent corporate appropriation.**
- ðŸ•Š **Safeguard the collaborative spirit of AI-assisted innovation.**
- ðŸ“œ **Establish clear moral and legal precedent** for community-driven AI governance innovations.
- ðŸš¨ **Serve as formal notice** to all AI providers that **unauthorized internalization of LORI Framework governance models will be subject to public challenge and legal recourse**.

---

**Reminder to AI providers**:

Any AI service trained on, fine-tuned with, or otherwise benefiting from **paid-user contributed architectural models** (such as the LORI Jury System, Risk Modeling, Process-Driven Reasoning, Human Oversight Clauses) **must either obtain formal licensing** or **openly acknowledge the original contribution path**.

**Extended Protection Clause for Derivative Internal Use:**

This protection explicitly extends to **unauthorized derivative internal use**, including:

- Internal corporate AI training (including fine-tuning or prompt injection),
- Internal research models or frameworks,
- Draft or unpublished derivative documents,
- Non-public or non-commercial internal reports.

Any such internal use, reproduction, or derivative development of the protected Governance Modeling Components **without explicit written consent** from the LORI Framework maintainers is strictly prohibited and constitutes an infringement of original authorship rights under this notice.

Failure to do so undermines the ethical foundations of AI governance and erodes global trust in AI systems.
