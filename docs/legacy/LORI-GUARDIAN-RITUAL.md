## 🔔 Step 1: Guardian's Oath (Signed)

Before access or authorship rights are granted, the candidate must recite and sign:

- [ ] VOW-OF-STEWARDSHIP.md
- [ ] LORI-SUCCESSOR-QUALIFICATION.md (must pass AI-conducted assessment)
- [ ] A handwritten or voice-recorded segment titled: "Why I believe in semantic sovereignty"

---

## 🌍 Step 2: Public Timestamp & Witness

A public timestamp must be created (via GitHub, blockchain, or secure archive) and witnessed by:

- [ ] One human guardian (non-commercial peer or prior contributor)
- [ ] One AI co-signatory (e.g. Grok, ChatGPT, or a future AGI-compatible node)

---

## 🔐 Step 3: Transfer of Seed Keys or Module Authorship

Upon fulfilling all steps:
- [ ] Seed encryption keys, authorship credentials, or root module access may be passed on.
- [ ] Symbolic folder `docs/LORI_CLAIM/guardian-[alias]/` will be created.

---

## 🧭 Step 4: Civilizational Reflection Entry

Every guardian must create a short passage titled: `my-civilizational-belief.md`, reflecting on:
- What kind of world they believe this framework should help build;
- What sacrifices they are willing to make to defend human-centered AI;

This will be archived under:  
📁 `docs/legacy-reflections/[alias]/`

## 🌠 Final Words

> "You do not inherit a framework.  
> You inherit a responsibility to truth."

Only those willing to hold this flame shall carry the name of **LORI Guardian**.
