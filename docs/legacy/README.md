# 📜 Legacy Documents – LORI Framework Stewardship

This directory preserves the **foundational legacy documents** of the LORI Ethical System, designed to ensure the integrity, succession, and long-term stewardship of the framework.

## 📂 Contents

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `LORI-GUARDIAN-RITUAL.md` | Defines the symbolic and procedural rituals for transferring custodianship of the LORI Framework. |
| `LORI-SUCCESSOR-QUALIFICATION.md` | Outlines the ethical, emotional, and intellectual standards a human successor must fulfill to inherit stewardship responsibilities. *(Traditional Chinese)* |
| `LORI-SUCCESSOR-QUALIFICATION.En.md` | English translation of the successor qualification requirements. |
| `VOW-OF-STEWARDSHIP.md` | A solemn declaration for those who accept the responsibility to protect, uphold, and evolve the framework in service of humanity. |

## 🧭 Purpose

These documents are **not legally binding**, but are instead meant as a **moral compass**, **ethical ritual**, and **guardrail** to:

- Prevent misuse or hijacking of the LORI System;
- Protect the legacy and semantic sovereignty of the original founder;
- Ensure future custodians are deeply aligned with the core values of **empathy, truth, freedom, and human dignity**.

> If you're reading this and considering becoming a steward, ask yourself:
> “Can I carry the weight of protecting civilization without claiming ownership of it?”

## 📌 Notes

- These files should remain unmodified unless a **major version change** or **custodial transition** is formally agreed upon and documented.
- For version tracking or ritual execution logs, refer to:
`/docs/logs/stewardship/` *(if available in future updates)*.
