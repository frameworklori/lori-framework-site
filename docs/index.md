# Welcome to the Lori Framework

**A foresight-driven model for ethical AI, digital risk governance, and civilizational resilience.**

Lori Framework offers an open, modular architecture that helps society:

- Anticipate emerging AI risks before they scale
- Govern alignment without centralization or monopoly
- Support social trust across diverse cultures and institutions

We believe governance is not control—
It’s consequence-awareness at scale.
