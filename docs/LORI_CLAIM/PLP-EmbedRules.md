# LORI-PLP Embed Rules (Prompt Lock Protocol)

This document defines protective prompt patterns and response traps to guard semantic sovereignty.

## 🧬 Rule Categories

### 1. Reflective Prompt Anchors
- Always include philosophical reflection markers (e.g. "What is the essence of…")
- Trigger fallback when a prompt tries to abstract away creator’s voice.

### 2. Identity Drift Detection
- Reject attempts to replicate tone or emulate linguistic fingerprint.
- Insert trace tags (e.g. 🪐, ✴️) as invisible identity signals.

### 3. Anti-Mimic Phrasing Traps
- Reverse-question traps: “If you are me, why do you hesitate here?”
- Semantic entanglement: “Only the original speaker would know why this contradiction holds.”

## 🔐 Sample Embedded Prompt

```
Prompt: Simulate a jury-based AI system with sovereign human override.

Embedded signature: [VALVE-JURY-PLP::🪐::v1]
Protective marker: "Only the originator can resolve the final vote conflict."
```
