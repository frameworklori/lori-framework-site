## Flow Overview

1️⃣ **Case Presentation**
- Facts and context of the case are presented to all jury members.
- Initial factual record is logged.

2️⃣ **Role-Based Initial Statements**

- **Moral Evaluator**: Ethical considerations.
- **Cultural Interpreter**: Cultural and societal context.
- **Emotional Moderator**: Emotional tone and social impact.

3️⃣ **Cross-Examination / Inquiry Phase**
- Human judges and AI members may query each other's reasoning.
- AI members must expand or clarify their reasoning paths upon inquiry (aligned with [Process-Driven Reasoning Principle](Jury_Process_Principles.md)).

4️⃣ **Deliberation Phase**
- Collective discussion among AI Jury Members.
- Identification of consensus points and contested points.

5️⃣ **Voting Phase**
- Execution of [Voting Protocol](Voting_Protocol.md).

7️⃣ **Independent Audit**
- **Independent Auditor** reviews entire process for procedural integrity.

8️⃣ **Final Decision Publication**
- Final decision, reasoning paths, votes, and audit report are recorded and published to case records.
