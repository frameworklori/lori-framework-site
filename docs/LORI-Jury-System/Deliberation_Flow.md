# Deliberation Flow
**LORI Jury-Based Judgment System**
**Version: v1.0**
**Date: 2025-06-08**

---

## Purpose

Defines the standard **deliberation process flow** used within the LORI Jury-Based Judgment System.
Ensures that all AI and human participants follow a consistent, transparent, and traceable process during case evaluation and decision-making.

---

## Flow Overview

1️⃣ **Case Presentation**
- Facts and context of the case are presented to all jury members.
- Initial factual record is logged.

2️⃣ **Role-Based Initial Statements**
- Each AI Jury Member role provides an initial statement:
- **Fact Finder**: Evidence and factual analysis.
- **Legal Analyst**: Legal framework and relevant precedents.
- **Moral Evaluator**: Ethical considerations.
- **Cultural Interpreter**: Cultural and societal context.
- **Emotional Moderator**: Emotional tone and social impact.

3️⃣ **Cross-Examination / Inquiry Phase**
- Human judges and AI members may query each other's reasoning.
- AI members must expand or clarify their reasoning paths upon inquiry (aligned with [Process-Driven Reasoning Principle](Jury_Process_Principles.md)).

4️⃣ **Deliberation Phase**
- Collective discussion among AI Jury Members.
- Identification of consensus points and contested points.

5️⃣ **Risk Control Modeling and Percentage Reporting**
- Each AI member provides **percentage-based confidence levels** for their reasoning (e.g., 85% support, 10% uncertainty, 5% opposition).
- Case sensitivity risk factors are also reported (e.g., ethical sensitivity, legal sensitivity).
- Results are logged for transparency.

6️⃣ **Voting Phase**
- Execution of [Voting Protocol](Voting_Protocol.md).
- Aggregate voting results must present a **risk-controlled percentage range** (e.g., 70–90% consensus confidence).
- All votes logged with accompanying reasoning.

7️⃣ **Human Judge Review**
- **Main Sovereignty Judge** reviews AI voting outcomes and reasoning.
- May approve, modify, or override decisions based on human sovereignty principles.

8️⃣ **Independent Audit**
- **Independent Auditor** reviews entire process for procedural integrity.

9️⃣ **Final Decision Publication**
- Final decision, reasoning paths, votes, and audit report are recorded and published to case records.

---

## Logging and Traceability Standards

- All phases are fully logged with timestamps.
- AI reasoning paths and human judge commentary must be recorded.
- All deliberation transcripts stored in **Jury CASE Records**.

---

## Planned Enhancements

- Development of **mathematical risk modeling framework (v1.0)** for percentage-based reasoning validation.
- Integration with **LORI Framework Global Risk Indicators**.
- Real-time deliberation monitoring tools.
- Dynamic adaptation for case sensitivity levels.
- Cross-case learning and adaptation mechanisms.
