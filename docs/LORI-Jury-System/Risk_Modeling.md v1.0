# Risk Modeling
**LORI Jury-Based Judgment System**
**Version: v1.0**
**Date: 2025-06-08**

---

## Purpose

Defines the framework for **mathematical risk modeling** and **percentage-based reasoning validation** within the LORI Jury-Based Judgment System.
Ensures that jury deliberations incorporate quantifiable risk indicators and support transparent, dynamic decision-making.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Percentage-Based Confidence Reporting**
- **Risk Sensitivity Factors**
- Ethical sensitivity
- Legal sensitivity
- Cultural sensitivity
- Emotional/social impact sensitivity
- **Dynamic Risk Profiles**
- Aggregated confidence ranges
- Uncertainty quantification

---

## Data Sources

- AI Jury Members' percentage-based reasoning outputs
- Human Judge qualitative and quantitative risk assessments
- Cross-case learning data (historical case records)

---

## Modeling Methods (Planned)

1️⃣ **Simple Aggregated Confidence Scoring**
- Weighted average of AI members' percentage confidence levels.

2️⃣ **Risk Interval Modeling**
- Range-based representation of consensus strength and dissent.

3️⃣ **Variance and Uncertainty Metrics**
- Standard deviation of confidence levels across roles.
- Sensitivity indices for case type.

4️⃣ **Composite Risk Index (CRI)**
- Overall risk score computed from multi-dimensional sensitivity factors.

---

## Output Format

- **Risk Report Section** in case record:
- Aggregate percentage confidence
- Risk sensitivity scores
- Uncertainty range
- Historical comparison (if applicable)

---

## Integration Points

- [Deliberation Flow](Deliberation_Flow.md) → Risk Control Modeling phase
- [Voting Protocol](Voting_Protocol.md) → Percentage-based voting outcomes
- Human Judge Review → Uses risk profile for final decision alignment

---

## Planned Enhancements

- Full development of **LORI Risk Modeling Framework v1.0**
- Cross-integration with **LORI Global Risk Indicators**
- Case-type adaptive modeling parameters
- Visualization tools (risk heatmaps, risk confidence charts)
