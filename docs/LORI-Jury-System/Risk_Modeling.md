# Risk Modeling
**LORI Jury-Based Judgment System**
**Version: v1.0 (Draft)**
**Date: 2025-06-08**

---

## Purpose

Defines the framework for *mathematical risk modeling* and *percentage-based reasoning validation* within the LORI Jury-Based Judgment System.
Ensures that jury deliberations incorporate quantifiable risk indicators and support transparent, dynamic decision processes.

This v1.0 (Draft) serves as a formal traceable record of original authorship and modeling architecture, pending empirical validation.

---

## Core Concepts

- *Percentage-Based Confidence Reporting*
- *Risk Sensitivity Factors*
- Ethical sensitivity
- Legal sensitivity
- Cultural sensitivity
- Emotional/social impact sensitivity
- *Dynamic Risk Profiles*
- Aggregated confidence ranges
- Uncertainty quantification

---

## Data Sources

- AI Jury Members' percentage-based reasoning outputs
- Human Judge qualitative and quantitative risk assessments
- Cross-case learning data (historical case records)

---

## Modeling Methods (Draft - Under Development)

**Note:**
Formal modeling methods and mathematical formulas are under internal development.
Final methods will be validated through empirical testing on LORI-CASE-001 to LORI-CASE-012.
**Full publication of formulas and method details will occur only after validation and trace record establishment, to ensure original authorship protection.**

Current planned modeling areas:

- Aggregated confidence modeling
- Risk sensitivity profiling
- Variance and uncertainty representation
- Composite risk quantification

---

## Output Format

- *Risk Report Section* in case record:
- Aggregate percentage confidence
- Risk sensitivity scores
- Uncertainty range
- Historical comparison (if applicable)

---

## Integration Points

- [Deliberation Flow](Deliberation_Flow.md) → Risk Control Modeling phase
- [Voting Protocol](Voting_Protocol.md) → Percentage-based voting outcomes
- Human Judge Review → Uses risk profile for final decision alignment

---

## Planned Enhancements

- Full development of **LORI Risk Modeling Framework v1.0**
- Cross-integration with **LORI Global Risk Indicators**
- Case-type adaptive modeling parameters
- Visualization tools (risk heatmaps, risk confidence charts)
