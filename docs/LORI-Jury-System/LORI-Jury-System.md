## Overview

The **LORI Jury-Based Judgment System** is a multi-agent, multi-role ethical adjudication mechanism embedded within the LORI Framework.
It is designed to provide **transparent, explainable, and human-sovereign governance decisions**, particularly for complex ethical dilemmas, AI regulation, and public interest cases.

The system integrates **AI Jury Members** with diverse roles and **Human Sovereignty Judges**, ensuring that all decisions are process-driven, verifiable, and accountable.
