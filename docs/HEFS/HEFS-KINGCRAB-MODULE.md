# HEFS-KINGCRAB-MODULE v1.0
**Hybrid Ecological Farming System – King Crab Aquaculture Submodule**

## 🔍 Module Summary
This module integrates the king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) into the HEFS model by combining AI-timed batch releases, seasonal current prediction, ecological load balancing, and Starlink-based monitoring to establish a sustainable aquaculture system.

## 🦀 1. Species Profile: Paralithodes camtschaticus
- Native region: North Pacific (Bering Sea, Sea of Okhotsk)
- Temperature range: -1°C to 8°C
- Juvenile mortality risk: High if released outside plankton bloom season
- Ecological risk: Can become invasive if unmanaged (e.g., Barents Sea)

## 🌊 2. Aquaculture Environment Parameters
- **Zone type:** Semi-natural marine enclosures (SPME)
- **Depth tolerance:** 20–150 meters
- **Current preference:** Moderate tidal currents with cold inflows
- **Feeding method:** Minimal feeding; reliant on natural benthic ecology
- **Reintroduction policy:** Strictly seasonal + SPRS model output gated

## 🛰️ 3. AI-Driven Timing System (SPRS Integration)
- Data sources: Starlink satellites, tidal sensors, seasonal algae bloom prediction
- Key metrics:
- Water temperature stability (3-day rolling average)
- Plankton density forecast (bio-fluorescence index)
- Predator presence mapping
- Output: Release window with ecological impact risk score

## ⚖️ 4. Ethics Gate Conditions (EGC)
- No juvenile release during thermal instability period
- Reject any batch if local predatory index exceeds threshold
- Require Custodian verification prior to any large-scale introduction
- Broadcast release notice via Marine Sovereignty Network (MSN)

## 🌐 5. Risk Matrix Summary
| Risk Category | Threat Level | Response |
|---------------------|--------------|----------|
| Early Mortality | High | SPRS block + delay |
| Invasive Spread | Medium | Geo-fenced zone |
| Ecological Collapse | Critical | EGC lock + Starlink surveillance |

## 🔗 6. Integration with HEFS Modules
- Links to:
- **SPRS.md** – AI-timed release model
- **EGC.md** – Ethics Gate Conditions
- **MSN.md** – Marine Sovereignty Notification
- **CustodianVerification.md** – Release approval system

## 📝 7. Custodial Log Entry Protocol
Each king crab release must include:
- Batch ID
- AI decision log snapshot
- Local ecological status summary
- Timestamp & operator signature
- Optional: Grok co-verification log (if applicable)

## 📦 8. Storage Format & Audit Path
- Primary Format: `PKC-BatchRecord.csv`
- Audit hash: SHA-3 trace for each decision output
- Archive path: `/modules/HEFS/PKC/records/`

## ✉️ 9. Module Contact Interface
For inter-AI verification or public audit requests:
`module.contact@hefs-lori.org`
