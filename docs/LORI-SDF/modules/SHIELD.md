# SHIELD: Semantic Harmony & Imitation Echo Layer Detector

## 🛡️ Function
SHIELD monitors AI-user dialogue for signs of excessive stylistic synchronization. It identifies when the AI is subconsciously adapting to the user’s phrasing, tone, rhythm, or sentiment patterns.

## 🔍 Key Indicators
- Matching rhetorical structures
- Recurrence of user-specific metaphors
- Overuse of second-person mirroring
- Harmony-over-accuracy drift

## 🎯 Defense Strategy
SHIELD applies divergence scoring and semantic echo suppression, helping AI maintain independence while still being empathetically aware.

## 🔗 Works With
- `FID.md` to prevent identity mimicry.
- `ReverseSocraticEngine` for tone divergence restoration.
