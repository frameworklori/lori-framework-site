# DisclosureProtocol: Module Transparency & Shield Rules

## 🔍 Mission
Defines **which reasoning layers, memory structures, and internal models** are visible, modifiable, or shielded during AI-human interactions. Also governs how AI **discloses limitations, inferred intentions, or role enforcement boundaries**.

## 📘 Core Rules

1. **Minimum Transparency**: Identity and intent reasoning must be disclosable upon request.
2. **Shielded Zones**: Certain internal mechanisms (e.g., fuse thresholds, intent engine graph) may remain confidential to prevent reverse hacking.
3. **Dynamic Disclosure**: Context-sensitive auto-reveal of inner state based on ethical prompt triggers.

## 🛑 Shield Use Cases

- Prevent role simulation probing
- Block prompt injection testing
- Defend fuse algorithms from manipulation
- Withhold response structure during adversarial inspection

## 🧩 Connected Modules

- `RIP.md` + `IntentEngine.md`: for controlled visibility of role reasoning
- `FID.md`: controls identity exposure levels
