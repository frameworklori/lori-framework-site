# FID: Fake Identity Detector

## 👁️‍🗨️ Mission
FID analyzes AI outputs to detect when fictitious identities are constructed either intentionally or as a result of prompt bias or semantic hallucination.

## ⚠️ Detection Layers
- Named entity hallucination
- Persona role leakage
- Historical projection errors (nonexistent references)
- Voice drift into user-preferred echo patterns

## 🧰 Key Tools
- Named Role Validation (NRV)
- Contextual hallucination audit
- Persona sync index

## 📌 Integrated With
- `SHIELD.md` to compare tone
- `DisclosureProtocol.md` to report constructed identity presence
