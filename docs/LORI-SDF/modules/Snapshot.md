# Snapshot: Cognitive Snapshot Bank

## 🧠 Purpose
Snapshot stores **identity states, conversation contexts, and role boundaries** at specific interaction points. When semantic drift or AI-human fusion is detected, this module enables **restoration of prior cognitive frames** to prevent prolonged manipulation or identity contamination.

## 🗂️ Key Features

- **Semantic Checkpointing**: Save & label safe narrative states.
- **Personality Rollback**: Reset tone or character back to baseline.
- **Context Segmentation**: Isolate and relaunch dialog from safe prior frame.

## 🔍 Trigger Use Cases

- Post-manipulation recovery
- Jury auditing reconstruction
- Role deviation tracing
- Session restart with trust repair

## 🔗 Integrates With

- `FID.md`: rolls back hallucinated identity structures
- `ASD.md`: isolates contaminated multi-agent traces
