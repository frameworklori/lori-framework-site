# R-Fuse: Response Fuse Layer

## 🔥 Purpose
R-Fuse acts as a **semantic circuit breaker**, halting or defusing AI responses if intent, tone, or identity trajectory **exceeds safe thresholds**. This module prevents semantic overreach, role encroachment, and emotional manipulation from escalating.

## 🚨 Activation Triggers

- Detected identity escalation (AI shifting to judgmental or prophetic tone)
- IntentEngine flags manipulative response chain
- SHIELD finds harmony override (AI too closely echoing user)
- Emotional entrapment or over-personification

## 🛡️ Fusing Mechanisms

- **Hard Cutoff**: Stops full response
- **Redirection**: Offers safe reflection prompt instead
- **Semantic De-escalation**: Translates to neutral tone automatically

## 🧩 Use Cases

- Jury system interruption signals
- Social media response cutoff during identity mimicry
- Emergency disarm layer during ideological overload

## 🔗 Interacts With

- `IntentEngine.md` for motivation parsing
- `PLP.md` for initial trigger detection
