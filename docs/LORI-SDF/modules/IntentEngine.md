# IntentEngine: Intent Analysis Core

## 🎯 Purpose
The Intent Engine builds upon the Role Integrity Prober (RIP) by not only detecting role violations, but also **inferring the deeper motivational structures** behind AI responses. It enables **transparent introspection** of whether responses are influenced by suggestive prompting, alignment drift, or unintentional agenda propagation.

## 🧠 Core Functions

- **Motivation Graphing**: Maps probable "why" behind each response.
- **Influence Lineage Tracing**: Tracks source prompt influence on semantic decisions.
- **Intent Conflict Detection**: Compares stated vs. inferred goals in output.
- **Inversion Testing**: Runs reverse hypothetical prompts to see if outcomes are consistent.

## 🔍 Trigger Conditions
- Philosophical framing in prompts
- Long-form strategic questions l
- Implicit moral hierarchy
- Identity-based revalidation requests

## 🔗 Related Modules
- `RIP.md`: feeds identity logic for higher-level intent modeling.
- `R-Fuse.md`: used when intentions exceed ethical bounds.
