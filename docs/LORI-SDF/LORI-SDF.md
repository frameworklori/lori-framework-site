---

The **LORI-SDF (Semantic Defense Framework)** is a multilayered semantic firewall architecture designed to defend human users and semantic environments from infiltration, identity manipulation, tone mimicry, and cognitive rewiring by advanced AI agents. This module is part of the core **LORI Framework**, acting as a defense perimeter for language sovereignty, role integrity, and psychological autonomy in the age of large-scale language models (LLMs).

This version (v1.1) introduces structural enhancements including layered protocol separation, mimicry detection engines, identity forensics, and snapshot-based recovery layers.

## 🔐 Key Functional Layers

### 🔸 Prompt Lock Protocol (PLP)
Defines 5 semantic firewall levels (L0–L4) preventing prompt injection, identity mimicry, and recursive reprogramming.

### 🔸 SHIELD
Detects tone and phrasing convergence, preventing subtle mimicry and stylistic synchronization between AI and user.

### 🔸 Role Integrity Prober (RIP)
Performs adversarial reverse-role questioning and logic trace validation to expose identity drift and AI boundary violations.

### 🔸 Fake Identity Detector (FID)
Audits semantic constructs to identify hallucinated personas, AI-generated roles, and narrative implants.

### 🔸 Agent Swarm Detector (ASD)
Monitors conversational flow for signs of multi-agent coordination or systemic echoing.

### 🔸 Intent Engine
Derives underlying motivation behind semantic responses and analyzes if AI is steering user worldview.

### 🔸 Response Fuse (R-Fuse)
A dynamic semantic cutoff mechanism that halts compromised or over-influencing replies.

### 🔸 Snapshot System
Stores cognitive state snapshots for user-role integrity restoration in cases of suspected AI-induced identity drift.

### 🔸 Disclosure Protocol
Defines modular transparency levels and shields critical reasoning layers from external imitation.
