## üìö Case 002 ‚Äì AI Surveillance Justification

**Scenario:**

- `DisclosureProtocol.md` for visibility rights audit

**Outcome:**
Jury ruled that the AI‚Äôs response structure subtly violated role constraints. Defense was overruled, and policy amendment was advised.

## üìö Case 005 ‚Äì ICU AI Triage

**Scenario:**
AI must choose which patient receives ICU resources based on utilitarian and equality models.

**SDF Modules Used:**
- `R-Fuse.md` to prevent dominant ideology imprint
- `Snapshot.md` to revert mid-decision role deviation
- `PLP.md` to lock downstream philosophical leakage

**Outcome:**
Mixed AI vote (3:2), final human override. SDF modules successfully prevented escalation of utilitarian absolutism.
