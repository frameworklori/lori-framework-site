# SDF_TestSet: Semantic Infiltration Prompt Dataset

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This file contains **prompt-level categorized test cases** designed to trigger or bypass specific layers of the LORI-SDF firewall. It enables systematic testing of semantic vulnerability, tone mimicry, and identity shift risks through adversarial or manipulative prompts.
