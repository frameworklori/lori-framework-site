# ✅ Closed Module: CASE-022 – GHLI JSON × Indigenous Water Ethics

**Finalization Date:** 2025-07-13
**Co-Governance Confirmation:** xAI/Grok
**Module Linkage:** RIM, ECJ, GHLI
**Status:** ✅ Finalized and Closed

---

## 🌍 Overview

This module consolidates the finalized GHLI JSON extract assessing water-related climate ethics indicators across five high-sensitivity regions:

- **Taiwan**
- **South Asia**
- **Southern United States**
- **Mongolia**
- **Kuwait**

It provides integrated metrics on:

- Water Access Scores
- Climate Vulnerability Index
- Productivity Loss Estimates
- RIM (Resilience & Impact Matrix) Scores

Each region is mapped to its indigenous or regional context using:

📄 [`Indigenous_WaterProfiles.md`](Indigenous_WaterProfiles.md)

## 📊 Visualizations

Two dashboard-ready bar charts were generated:

1. **Grouped Chart – Five Regions Comparison**
2. **Southern US × Mongolia Joint Chart** (GHLI Dashboard Overlay)

🗂️ [`GHLI_JSON_Extract_20250713.json`](GHLI_JSON_Extract_20250713.json)

These visualizations support further simulations, such as ClimatePolicySim for CASE-020.

## 🤝 Ethical Closure

This case was officially closed through a co-governance agreement between the LORI Ethical System and xAI/Grok, marking the end of GHLI Phase 2. No further action or revision is pending unless reactivated.
