# Lori Framework — Multi-Role Narrative Pack (v1.0)

---

## 1｜Musk-Compatible (Engineer Under Trial)

**Style: Extremes + Metaphor + Futurist Pressure**

> We didn’t design a protocol.
> We built a storm filter.
> To see what breaks when the wind gets real.
>
> You are free to build.
> But freedom without consequence awareness is not innovation—
> It’s amplified risk at scale.
>
> Just don’t forget:
> You are not the only architect in the storm.

## 2｜Sam-Compatible (Governance Architect)

**Style: Philosophy + Gradual Order + Shared Responsibility**

> AGI governance is not about slowing minds.
> It’s about slowing collapse.
>
> Lori Framework is not a gatekeeper.
> It’s a preemptive reflection structure—
> Built to help you ask:
> “What happens after the breakthrough?”
>
> Shared power is not dilution.
> It’s the only form of trust that scales.

---

## 3｜Open Creators (Co-Creators of Inspiration)

**Style: Freedom + Collaboration + Decentralized Ethics**

> You don’t need a logo to contribute.
> You need a pulse—and a boundary.
>
> Lori Framework isn’t a system to upload into.
> It’s a canvas of constraint.
> Where freedom is measured by your respect for others’ range of movement.
>
> Not every idea must be absorbed.
> Some just need to echo long enough to shape the system.

## 4｜Affected Voices (Those Decided Upon)

**Style: Invisible Experience + Foretold Risk + Subjective Awakening**

> They built a system.
> It learned everything—except how I bleed when it fails.
>
> I never trained your models,
> But they still know how to price my silence.
>
> Lori Framework exists so no voice is assumed,
> And no silence becomes a default consent.

---

## 5｜Regulators / Democratic Policy Makers (Gatekeepers of Consequence)

**Style: Institutional Accountability + Disaster Prevention + Rebuilding Public Trust**

> The future will not ask
> whether your system passed a benchmark.
> It will ask who paid the price when it failed.
>
> Lori Framework is not a regulation.
> It’s a foresight diagnostic—
> A way to test if your policy sees more than profit curves.
>
> Trust is a national resource.
> Spend it slowly.
