# 🌍 AI-Foodscan-global

## 📌 About
**AI-Foodscan-global** is a mobile-first project that brings **full transparency to food products worldwide**.
By simply scanning a barcode or packaging, users can instantly see:
✅ Price comparisons
✅ Expiration / Best-by dates
✅ Nutrition facts & calories
✅ Allergen alerts

Our mission: **Help families eat fresh, reduce waste, and cut healthcare costs.**

## 🚩 Why It Matters

### 🇺🇸 United States
- UPC barcodes don’t include expiration → consumers risk eating expired food.
- No unified cross-store price comparison.
- Rising medical costs linked to poor food freshness.

### 🇯🇵 Japan
- Strict allergen labeling (28 items), but only in brand-specific apps.
- Expiration mostly printed, not digital.
- Price transparency fragmented across convenience stores & supermarkets.

👉 **AI-Foodscan-global closes these gaps** by unifying expiry, allergen, nutrition, and price data.
