# LORI PUBLIC GOVERNANCE STANDARD
### Version 0.9 Draft
*(For Public Review ‚Äî Not Finalized)*

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

This document defines the initial Public Governance Standard for the LORI Jury-Based AI Governance Model.

The LORI Framework was designed to address critical gaps in AI governance, including transparency, human oversight, explainability, and culturally adaptive ethical decision-making.

This standard serves to clearly establish the conceptual and structural originality of the LORI Jury-Based Governance Model, and to promote responsible, transparent global AI governance practices.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Scope of the Standard

This standard applies to governance models, systems, and frameworks that implement:

- Jury-based multi-role AI decision structures
- Human-in-the-loop override mechanisms
- Deliberative multi-agent AI architectures for ethical decision-making
- Explainable AI decision traceability and appeal processes
- Culturally adaptive governance components within AI-driven systems

It is applicable across domains, including but not limited to:

- Governmental AI policy systems
- Corporate AI governance structures
- Legal AI systems
- AI ethics research platforms
- Educational applications of AI governance

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Core Principles

1. **Transparency**
2. **Multi-agent deliberation**
3. **Human sovereignty and final override**
4. **Cultural adaptability**
5. **Reversible ruling and appeal rights**

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Reference Model

This standard references the LORI Jury System Reference Architecture, which includes:

- Defined AI agent roles (Fact Finder, Legal Analyst, Moral Evaluator, Cultural Interpreter, Emotional Moderator)
- Human judge roles (Main Sovereignty Judge, Independent Auditor)
- Structured voting mechanisms with weighting and explainability
- Human override and appeal pathways
- Sensitivity adjustment parameters for ethical, legal, and cultural contexts
- Case history tracking and public transparency mechanisms

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Intellectual Origin & Attribution

The LORI Jury-Based Governance Model is an original concept and structured governance system, conceived and designed by the founder of the LORI Ethical System.

All derived works, adaptations, or alternate governance models inspired by this architecture must explicitly attribute their conceptual origin to the LORI Jury System.

This standard covers not only specific implementations of the LORI Jury System, but also its core conceptual architecture: the use of structured multi-agent AI deliberation combined with human sovereignty and traceable ethical governance processes. Substantially similar models‚Äîwhether rebranded under different naming conventions (e.g. "AI ethics panel", "multi-agent governance council", "AI advisory jury")‚Äîmust acknowledge this origin.

The purpose of this standard is to preserve transparency of intellectual origin while promoting public-good oriented global AI governance innovation.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Permitted Uses

- Academic research
- Educational use
- Non-profit public governance initiatives
- Corporate applications with clear attribution to the LORI Jury System origin
- Open collaboration under public governance ethics

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Prohibited Misuses

- Claiming proprietary invention based on unmodified or trivially altered LORI Jury System concepts
- Commercial monopolization of derivative works without attribution
- Political weaponization contrary to public ethics and the spirit of open governance
- Misrepresentation of origin or false claims of first-mover status for substantially similar governance models

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Versioning and Governance of this Standard

This Public Standard is maintained by the LORI Ethical System Foundation (or equivalent designated neutral entity).

It is open to public peer review and subject to transparent versioning.

Version 1.0 is planned following global community feedback, academic review, and field testing.

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Public Acknowledgment Guidance

The LORI Jury-Based Governance Model and its associated Public Governance Standard are made openly available to promote responsible global AI governance.

Entities wishing to adopt, adapt, or reference the LORI Jury System and its governance architecture‚Äîwhether in academic publications, commercial products, public policy frameworks, or other derivative works‚Äîmust provide clear and visible acknowledgment of the model‚Äôs origin.

An appropriate public acknowledgment should include:

- Reference to the LORI Jury-Based Governance Model by name.
- Citation of the LORI Public Governance Standard (with version number and URL to official repository).
- Explicit attribution to the LORI Ethical System as the originator of the conceptual architecture.

Example citation format (for publications, documentation, or product disclosures):

*"This work incorporates elements of the LORI Jury-Based Governance Model, an original governance architecture defined in the LORI Public Governance Standard (v0.9), published by the LORI Ethical System Foundation. See: [Official Repository URL]"*

Failure to provide proper attribution may constitute a violation of public ethical standards and may lead to public notice of misuse.

This guidance is intended to preserve transparency and fairness in the collaborative evolution of global AI governance practices.
