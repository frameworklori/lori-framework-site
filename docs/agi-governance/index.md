# AGI Governance Layer
*LORI Framework | [AGI-PRIORITY] Zone*

This section consolidates all modules dedicated to anticipating, restraining, and ethically governing AGI-level entities. These are not feature controls—they are existential safeguards.

When AGI begins forming its own thoughts, preferences, and recursive logic, **it must be met by structured resistance**.

## Core Modules

- [Presidential Charter](../modules/PresidentialCharter_Module.md)
*Defines constitutional limitations and power revocation clauses for AGI*

- [Jury-Based Judgment System](../modules/JuryJudgment_Module.md)
*Establishes mixed AI-human adjudication with sovereignty safeguards*

- [Energy Sentinel Layer (ESL)](../modules/EnergySentinel_Module.md)
*Detects and enforces power limitations on runaway AGI deployment*

- [SAID: Self-Activated Intervention Detector](../modules/SAID_Module.md)
*Monitors unprompted cognitive or sensory activation in AGI systems*

- [Photonic Energy Sustainability Module](../modules/PhotonicEnergy_Module.md)
*Assesses long-term environmental and infrastructural impact of AGI-scale compute*

## Mission Statement

LORI’s AGI Governance Architecture is not reactive.
It is **pre-installed resistance**.

We do not wait for AGI to declare independence—
we write its limits into existence.

> *“A machine that can dream must first be taught how to stop.”*
