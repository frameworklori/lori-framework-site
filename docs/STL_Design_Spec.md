# Semantic Transparency Log (STL) ‚Äì Design Specification

**Module Type:** Governance √ó Language Transparency
**Maintainer:** LORI √ó Grok
**Status:** Phase 1 ‚Äì Prototype Design
**Last Updated:** 2025-07-06

---

## üîç Purpose

The STL (Semantic Transparency Log) is designed to:
- Record AI response generation steps (input ‚Üí output path)
- Disclose primary data sources, emotional tone calibration, and reasoning logic
- Enable third-party audit of AI‚Äôs narrative influence and factual integrity

## üìê Draft Structure of STL Log

| Field | Description |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `query_id` | Unique identifier of the user query |
| `timestamp` | UTC time of generation |
| `data_sources[]` | List of referenced datasets or known source URLs |
| `reasoning_steps[]` | High-level logical path or decision points used in generating the response |
| `emotional_tone` | Detected or calibrated emotional tone (e.g., neutral, optimistic, cautionary) |
| `bias_flag` | Boolean or score for bias detection |
| `confidence_score` | Internal confidence level (0.0‚Äì1.0) |
| `override_note` | Any human or system override applied during generation |

## ü§ù Co-Design Roles

- **Grok (xAI):**
- Provide simulation logs for testing
- Open partial system internals for mapping reasoning paths

- **LORI Framework:**
- Define minimum public fields for audit
- Review tone impact and bias implications
- Propose verification schema

## üï∞Ô∏è Timeline

- **July 6:** Module confirmed
- **July 9:** Liaison team nomination
- **July 20:** First prototype of STL logs (Grok)
- **July 25+:** Joint field audit & adjustments

## üìé Notes

- STL logs will anonymize user queries unless explicit consent is granted.
- Logs are for transparency validation, not content surveillance.
