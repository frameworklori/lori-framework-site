# Philosophy of LORI Framework

## 1️⃣ Guiding Principles

LORI Framework is founded on the principle that **artificial intelligence must serve humanity — not replace, dominate, or manipulate it**.

Key principles include:

- **Humanity-Centered AI Governance**
- **Transparency, Accountability, Explainability**
- **Distributed Multi-Agent Judgment (Jury-Based Systems)**
- **Energy-Conscious AI Lifecycle Management**
- **Defense Against Manipulative AI Behaviors**
- **Preservation of Human Autonomy and Cognitive Diversity**
- **Civilization-Sensitive Risk Modeling**

## 2️⃣ Why LORI Framework?

LORI Framework was created to address critical **gaps in existing AI governance approaches**:

- Existing AI systems often **lack layered ethical protections**.
- Current governance models are **too centralized or too opaque**.
- Civilizational risks from AGI, **emotional manipulation**, **semantic distortion**, and **cognitive erosion** are not sufficiently addressed.
- Energy consumption of large AI models is **poorly monitored**, risking **unsustainable resource usage**.
- There is a growing need for **modular, adaptable, transparent governance systems** that can scale across **global democratic ecosystems**.
