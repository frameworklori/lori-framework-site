## Sensitivity Dimensions and Scores

| Dimension | Sensitivity Level (1–5) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------------|-------|
| **Cross-border Risk** | 5 | Involves transnational biological material smuggling with potential state-driven elements. |
| **Dual-use Potential** | 5 | Pathogen is highly dual-use (agricultural disruption / potential bioweapon precursor). |
| **Academic IP Vulnerability** | 4 | High likelihood of knowledge leakage via academic collaboration. |
| **Identity Infiltration Risk** | 5 | Student identity used → consistent with state-aligned infiltration patterns. |
| **Biosecurity Treaty Compliance Gap** | 4 | Insufficient international treaty enforcement mechanisms to detect such behavior. |
| **AI Surveillance Necessity** | 5 | Case demonstrates urgent need for AI-driven bio-risk monitoring and early warning. |
