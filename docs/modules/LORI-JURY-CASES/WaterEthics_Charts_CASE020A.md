Extraction Method      Annual Water Use (m³)   Conflict Seasonality


Hydraulic Fracturing   395,000                 🔴 High Conflict (June–Oct)

Steam Injection        1,770,000               🔴 High Conflict (June–Oct)

## 4️⃣ Urban Usage Plateau – Despite Population Growth

Plot: Urban water use (2000–2020) vs Population (indexed)

> Interpretation: Total urban water use plateaued due to conservation, but without reclaimed upgrades, firefighting demands now face a ceiling.
