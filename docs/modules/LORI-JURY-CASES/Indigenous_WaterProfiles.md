**LORI CASE-021 Supporting File**
**Focus: Indigenous Communities’ Water Rights, Vulnerabilities, and Ethical Considerations**

## 📍 Overview
This document summarizes the cultural, economic, and environmental relationships between major Indigenous communities in five regions (Taiwan, South Asia, Southern US, Kuwait, Mongolia) and their access to and dependence on freshwater resources. These insights directly inform the ethical deliberations in CASE-021 (Water Ethics).

---

## 🇹🇼 Taiwan – Tsou (鄒族)
- **Region:** Alishan mountain region, Chiayi County
- **Primary Water Use:** River water for agriculture (millet, taro), sacred springs for rituals
- **Climate Risk:** Droughts reducing mountain stream flow; over-extraction from lowland municipalities
- **Cultural Note:** Water sources often considered sacred, requiring community consensus to manage
- **Ethical Factor:** Urban water redirection threatens ancestral agricultural terraces and spiritual continuity

---

## 🇮🇳 South Asia – Bhil Tribe (India)
- **Region:** Western India (Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh)
- **Primary Water Use:** Traditional stepwells, rainwater harvesting, stream-diverted irrigation
- **Climate Risk:** Erratic monsoons, groundwater depletion, pollution from urban runoff
- **Cultural Note:** Bhil women are primary water stewards; spiritual beliefs embedded in water rituals
- **Ethical Factor:** Drought resilience weakened by state’s diversion of water to urban centers

---

## 🇺🇸 Southern US – Navajo Nation (Arizona, New Mexico, Utah)
- **Region:** Colorado Plateau
- **Primary Water Use:** Domestic needs, sheep herding, limited farming; heavy reliance on wells and springs
- **Climate Risk:** Severe droughts; uranium contamination of water; legal water access disputes
- **Cultural Note:** Water is sacred; Diné cosmology ties water to life and balance
- **Ethical Factor:** Urban and commercial water use prioritized over federally unfulfilled water rights

---

## 🇰🇼 Kuwait – Bedouin (Nomadic Tribes)
- **Region:** Desert interiors and southern borderlands
- **Primary Water Use:** Historically depended on seasonal oases and mobile cisterns; now rely on desalination supply
- **Climate Risk:** Total freshwater scarcity; 100% dependence on desalination and import
- **Cultural Note:** Water-sharing was a survival ethic in nomadic culture, now eroded
- **Ethical Factor:** Displacement and stateless status limit formal water access; not prioritized in infrastructure plans

---

## 🇲🇳 Mongolia – Dukha (Tsaatan) Reindeer Herders
- **Region:** Taiga forests near Russian border
- **Primary Water Use:** Glacier runoff, spring-fed rivers for reindeer care and human consumption
- **Climate Risk:** Glacier retreat, permafrost degradation, mining pollution
- **Cultural Note:** Water is part of shamanic cosmology; spiritual guardians linked to river sources
- **Ethical Factor:** Loss of alpine water threatens cultural livelihood; mining concessions override Indigenous claims

## 🧭 Cross-Case Ethical Insights
| Theme | Observation |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cultural Water Ethics | All five Indigenous groups treat water as sacred and community-managed |
| Legal Invisibility | Most Indigenous groups lack enforceable water rights or infrastructure access |
| Displacement Threats | Urban expansion and commercial extraction displace or deprioritize Indigenous water use |
| Resilience Role | Traditional water conservation knowledge often excluded from policy models |
| Ethical Tension | Jury systems must weigh survival rights × cultural rights × state obligations |
