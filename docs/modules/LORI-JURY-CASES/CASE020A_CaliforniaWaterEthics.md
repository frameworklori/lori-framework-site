## üß≠ Case Overview

California faces a structural water scarcity problem exacerbated by droughts, agriculture demands, wildfire threats, and urban expansion. This sub-case explores the ethical allocation and resilience challenges of water usage across five domains:

1. Household daily usage
2. Industrial and energy facility consumption
3. Oil shale extraction (e.g., hydraulic fracturing, steam injection)
4. Urban and commercial system loads
5. Public firefighting water reserves

---

## üîç Problem Focus

- **Conflict**: Emergency water for fire prevention (hydrants, reservoirs) vs. commercial/energy/urban extraction.
- **Ethical Dilemma**: Should public safety take priority over industrial continuity?
- **Underserved Groups**: Rural, Indigenous, and fire-prone communities often lack prioritized access.
- **Technology Gap**: Water reclamation systems are unevenly deployed; affluent districts often receive upgrades first.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Tensions

| Dimension | Conflict Description |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Safety vs Economy | Should energy or oil firms be allowed to draw during fire season? |
| Urban vs Rural | Are remote or low-income areas deprioritized in infrastructure upgrades? |
| Industry vs Ecology | Does heavy extraction threaten long-term aquifers and fire-adaptive landscapes? |
| Privatization Risk | How are reclaimed water systems governed‚Äîpublic equity or private profit? |

---

## üß™ Proposed Simulation Threads

- Redistribute reclaimed water investments toward fire-risk zones.
- Limit oil extraction water drawdown during critical fire season.
- AI-based optimization of municipal water release + firefighting routes.
- Emergency override rules for energy facilities during wildfire alerts.
