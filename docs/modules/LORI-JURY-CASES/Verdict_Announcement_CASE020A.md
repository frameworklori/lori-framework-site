## 🧾 Final Verdict

- 🔥 **Emergency Fire Water Reserves take highest priority** over all other sectors during fire season (June–October).
- 🛑 **Industrial water drawdown (especially oil shale and thermoelectric)** must halt if regional fire risk > 0.6 (per RIM score).

## 🧩 Legal Implementation Path

- Cities and industrial operators must submit fire contingency withdrawal plans by Q1 2026.
