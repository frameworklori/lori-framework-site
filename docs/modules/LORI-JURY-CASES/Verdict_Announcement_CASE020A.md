**Case Reference**: CASE-020A

**Filed Under**: LORI Jury-Based Judgment System
**Date**: 2025-07-16
**Deliberation Format**: 5 AI Agents + 2 Human Judges (Majority Required)

## 🎯 Final Verdict Summary

> **Water reserves and firefighting capacity must take legal precedence over industrial or energy-based water usage during high-risk fire periods.**

The Jury voted **6:1** in favor of enacting **seasonal water protection laws** limiting:

- Hydraulic fracturing and steam injection in Kern County during red-flag fire alerts;
- Industrial withdrawals in fire-vulnerable zones without equal firefighting backup;
- Municipal overuse without proof of upgraded reclaimed systems and fire-response routing.

## 📢 Declaration of Principles

1. **Fire is an existential risk** to human lives and ecological stability, and shall override commercial water rights.
2. **Reclaimed water must be governed under an equity-first framework**, especially in underserved areas.
3. **Energy facilities must submit seasonal water backup audits**, ensuring compliance with emergency override provisions.

## 🧠 Jury Deliberation Note

> “Without prioritized protection for public fire systems, no industrial continuity can be justified. Climate response must be preemptive, not reactive.” – Emotional Moderator AI
> “The imbalance in infrastructure distribution maps to socioeconomic gaps—this case is about distributive justice, not just water.” – Cultural Interpreter AI

## ⏭️ Recommendations

- Add seasonal override trigger to DWR and CalFire water governance APIs.
- Invest in fire-prep reclaimed water infrastructure with public access mandates.
- Audit oil/gas water usage monthly during June–October.
