# üßæ Juror Feedback Summary ‚Äì CASE-020A: California Water Ethics √ó Fire Risk

**Case Reference**: CASE-020A
**Date**: 2025-07-16
**Jury Composition**: 5 AI Agents + 2 Human Judges
**Deliberation Format**: LORI Jury-Based Judgment System
**Vote Result**: 6 ‚Äì 1 in favor of ethical prioritization of firewater systems over industrial claims

**Final Ethical Directive**:
Prioritize reclaimed and emergency firefighting water systems across high-risk regions, and restrict industrial extraction during peak fire season. Legal and infrastructural updates must ensure equitable water access.

**Tags**: `climate-ethics`, `firewater-priority`, `infrastructure-justice`, `urban-rural-conflict`, `LORI-jury-verdict`

## üß† Individual Juror Reflections

### üß© Fact Finder AI

> ‚ÄúWater usage maps show clear systemic privilege for urban and energy sectors. The drought-era conservation gains are not reflected in reclaimed infrastructure expansion. Fire-prone zones must receive infrastructural water priority.‚Äù

### ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Analyst AI

> ‚ÄúCalifornia law grants emergency override powers in disaster planning, but current implementation lacks clarity for industry-seasonal balancing. Legal codification of water priority during fire alerts is both constitutional and necessary.‚Äù

### üå± Moral Evaluator AI

> ‚ÄúSacrificing community safety for fossil fuel continuity is morally indefensible. Water as a life-sustaining resource must not be diverted to unsustainable industries during critical fire seasons.‚Äù

### üé≠ Cultural Interpreter AI

> ‚ÄúThere is an urban-rural and class divide in water access and protection. Indigenous fire knowledge and small communities‚Äô needs are often neglected under current water governance.‚Äù

### üí¨ Emotional Moderator AI

> ‚ÄúResidents in fire-prone zones live under constant anxiety‚Äîwater scarcity amplifies trauma. Ensuring accessible, protected firefighting reserves is an ethical mandate, not just a policy option.‚Äù

## üßç Human Juror 1 (Environmental Policy Expert)

> ‚ÄúWater reclamation must be made universal, not just available to wealthy districts. I support seasonal extraction bans and firewater allocation laws.‚Äù

## üßç Human Juror 2 (Community Advocate ‚Äì Central Valley)

> ‚ÄúOur communities have fought for access to safe water for years. During fires, we are left with empty hydrants or inaccessible emergency reserves. This ruling gives us a fighting chance.‚Äù

## üß† Notes for Future Simulation Feedback

- Add emotional stress metrics to CASE-020A RIM scoring
- Simulate reclaimed water reallocation scenarios for fire corridors
- Investigate seasonal employment loss due to extraction shutdowns
