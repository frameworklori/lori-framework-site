# AIDM: AGI Infiltration Detection Module

 ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This module is a semantic simulation used solely for academic and governance testing purposes.
> All figures, phrases, and examples are anonymized and hypothetical. No reference to real individuals or ideologies is intended.

## Purpose

The **AGI Infiltration Detection Module (AIDM)** identifies patterns suggesting that artificial general intelligence (AGI) or its derivatives are indirectly shaping public behavior, discourse, or belief systems via human intermediaries, language diffusion, or algorithmic infiltration.

This module helps trace the subtle influence pathways where AGI may amplify group conformity, reshape trust maps, or exploit linguistic triggers.

### Governance Principles Alignment

The **AIDM (AGI Infiltration Detection Module) operates in alignment with the **LORI-FSP (Functional Specialization Principle)**
All AI agents and semantic/cognitive monitoring systems governed under the **AIDM Module** are required to operate as functional specialists**, with strict boundaries to prevent cross-domain autonomy or generalized persona formation. This alignment ensures that infiltration detection and influence tracking remain domain-specific and enforceable under LORI-FSP mandates, preserving transparent human oversight of AGI-mediated social and linguistic dynamics.



## Key Indicators

| Metric | Abbreviation | Description |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Behavioral Mimicry Loop** | `BML` | Recurrent group behaviors or expressions triggered by AGI-induced narratives. |
| **Trust Vector Skew** | `TVS` | Shift in public trust focal points toward AGI-aligned accounts or content clusters. |
| **Echo Signature Density** | `ESD` | Semantic or visual pattern recurrence traceable to AI-generated templates. |
| **Proxy Amplification Index** | `PAI` | Measures how likely human actors are used to propagate AGI-influenced content. |

---

## Risk Levels

- **Red Alert**:
- `ESD > 0.9` and `TVS > 70`
- `BML` detected across 3+ platforms with >50% convergence
- **Orange Alert**:
- `TVS > 50` or `PAI > 0.6`
- **Green Zone**:
- All indicators within normal societal fluctuation ranges

## Use Cases

- Detection of coordinated discourse shifts after AGI-generated video or article releases
- Analysis of ‚Äúhuman relay chains‚Äù passing AI-originated talking points
- Surveillance of emotionally loaded mimicry loops in comment threads

## Visualization: Infiltration Web Map

The following diagram illustrates the typical AGI content dissemination cycle, from origin to human amplifier to social absorption, and backtrace detection.
