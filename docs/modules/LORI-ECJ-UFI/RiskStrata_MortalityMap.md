# ECJ × UFI Expansion Layer
**Risk-Strata Mortality Mapping System**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To expose and structurally model how **climate-related mortality** is **unequally distributed across social, economic, and geographic strata**, especially when such deaths are **unreported, undercounted, or systematically ignored**.

This module fuses the justice lens of `LORI-ECJ` with the surveillance capabilities of `UFI`, producing a **layered mortality-risk framework** applicable to global policy, predictive systems, and post-collapse reconstruction ethics.

## 🧬 Core Thesis

> "Death does not fall equally. It falls on the voiceless first — and uncounted deaths erase accountability."

- Climate collapse is not a uniform event.
- Mortality emerges in waves, beginning from the socio-geographic margins.
- When death is not recorded, it is not acknowledged.
- When it is not acknowledged, it is not prevented.

This module exists to **map the invisible attrition** and **restore ethical weight** to erased populations.

## 🔻 Risk Stratification Table

| Strata | Socioeconomic Class | Geographic Exposure | Mortality Type | Reporting Risk |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Tier 1 | Poorest 10% | Low-elevation, equatorial zones | Heat stroke, famine, migration death | Likely suppressed or ignored |
| Tier 2 | Urban working poor | Coastal/riverine slums | Floods, disease, infrastructure failure | Underreported |
| Tier 3 | Rural moderate-income | Semi-arid regions | Crop loss, suicide, disease | Weak reporting networks |
| Tier 4 | Urban middle class | Inland cities, stable states | Stress-related, delayed collapse | Officially recorded |
| Tier 5 | Elites / climate-migrated | Fortified zones | Minimal direct death | Overrepresented in policy protections |

## 🔬 Module Components

### 🔹 1. UFI–ECJ Risk Overlay
- Combines unreported fatality signals (DSS, SPD, ARA) with LORI-ECJ’s Aid Allocation Bias (AAB) and Emission-Impact Disparity (EID).

### 🔹 2. Mortality-Invisibility Index (MII)
- Score from 0 to 1 indicating how likely a region’s deaths will be **systemically uncounted**.

### 🔹 3. Geo-Strata Disappearance Projection (GSDP)
- Timeline forecast showing which social strata and regions will reach **functional collapse or mass mortality first**, under current policy inertia.

## 📡 Use Case

- Early warning and prioritization for aid allocation
- Justified escalation of visibility for hidden humanitarian zones
- Long-term mortality trend analysis under different CO₂ emissions scenarios
- Ethical documentation of **death under silence**

## 📜 Philosophical Anchor

>" When faced with the extinction of other species, humanity often chooses intervention.
But when facing the possibility of its own extinction, humanity does not unite — it turns to conflict.”
