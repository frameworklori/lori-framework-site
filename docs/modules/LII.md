# LII: Linguistic Incendiary Index

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This module is a semantic simulation used solely for academic and governance testing purposes.  
> All figures, phrases, and examples are anonymized and hypothetical. No reference to real individuals or ideologies is intended.

> Measures how likely a piece of language (spoken, written, AI-generated) may trigger emotional conflict, imitation, or social unrest.

## 🔥 Overview

This 2D index maps the intersection of emotional **Trigger** and social **Amplification**. When both factors are high, language spreads rapidly, often provoking imitation or emotional contagion.

Y-axis: Amplification (social spread potential)
X-axis: Trigger (emotional intensity)

> 📊 **Interpretation**:  
> The top-right quadrant represents **high-risk language** — emotionally triggering and socially amplified.  
> These phrases often trigger mimicry, ideological resonance, or algorithmic virality.  
> The circle labeled “Social Imitation Module” visualizes this hotspot, while the “Radius of Mimicry” illustrates potential echo spread.  
> All outputs flagged in this zone are subject to LORI Framework Jury System evaluation.

## 🧠 Core Components

- **Incendiary Term Detection**  
  Identifies emotionally charged or provocative language patterns.

- **Cultural Sensitivity Context**  
  Evaluates how terms shift meaning across cultural or demographic boundaries.

- **Amplification Risk Score**  
  Predicts the potential for viral spread, misinterpretation, or incitement.

## 🔍 New Interlinked Modules (2025 Update)

| Module | Function | Purpose of Integration |
|--------|----------|------------------------|
| `SPR.md` – Semantic–Pragmatic Reversal | Detects inversion of meaning in hostile or coded language | Enhances cultural decoding and ambiguity detection |
| `AIDM.md` – AGI Infiltration Detection | Tracks AI-generated phrases that mimic human incendiary speech | Evaluates synthetic origins of conflict-driving language |
| `LORI-NCS.md` – Narrative Control Scanner | Scans for weaponized or over-amplified narrative threads | Adds context to source and trajectory of language spread |
| `Super Resonant Entity Map` | Identifies idol-triggered semantic convergence | Visual tool for mapping ideological amplification loops |

---

## 🧪 Use Cases

- Detecting hate speech or veiled ideological incitement
- Scoring AI-generated outputs before public deployment
- Assisting platform moderation teams in pre-escalation filtering
- Supporting LORI Jury simulations in semantic trigger analysis

---

## 🛰️ Future Expansion (Planned)

- **Temporal Re-Trigger Loop**: Time-based reactivation index for latent trigger terms.
- **Language Sovereignty Pack Compatibility**: Ready for regional tuning under `LanguageSovereignty-Pack.md`.
