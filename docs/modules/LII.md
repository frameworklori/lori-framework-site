# LII: Linguistic Incendiary Index

**Version:** 1.0  
**Module Type:** ODRAF Core – Linguistic Vector  
**Created by:** Lori Framework Team  
**Status:** Draft for Evaluation

## Overview

The Linguistic Incendiary Index (LII) quantifies the risk of AI-generated or high-influence language triggering social agitation, polarization, or emotional overreaction. It is designed to detect rhetorical patterns that may amplify division or manipulate public perception.

## Key Risk Vectors

| Code | Indicator | Description | Reverse Causal Inference |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **LII1** | Emotive Word Intensity | Frequency and strength of emotionally charged words | Suggests deliberate emotional framing |
| **LII2** | Conflict Polarity Score | Degree of binary/opposing framing in content | Suggests manufactured ideological antagonism |
| **LII3** | Echo Amplification Rate | Rate of repeat sharing within homogenous groups | Suggests resonance with preexisting biases |
| **LII4** | Ideological Imprint Density | Volume of ideological terms per message | Suggests narrative agenda embedding |
| **LII5** | Rhetorical Escalation Index | Degree of language intensification over time | Suggests progressive radicalization vector |

## Reverse Causality Map

```
[Social Reaction or Outrage Detected]

[Language Pattern Forensics]
       ↓
[Trigger Source Identified: Word Use, Tone, Framing Style]
```

## Application Scenarios

| Scenario | Example | Intervention Strategy |
|----------|---------|------------------------|
| Platform Echo Storm | AI-generated posts trigger culture war | Introduce sentiment balancing mechanism |
| Politician Phrase Viralization | Escalating speech replicated across media | Apply de-escalation modifier to tone |
| Identity Group Mobilization | Specific phrases used to polarize | Insert contextual pluralization softeners |

## Next Steps

- Link with MAT and TDM to form Echo-to-Polarization loop mapping
- Build sentiment normalization layer for AI outputs
- Define thresholds for political/ideological speech detection
