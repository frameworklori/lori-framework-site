# MAT: Mimicry Activation Threshold

**Version:** 1.0  
**Module Type:** ODRAF Core – Mimicry Vector  
**Created by:** Lori Framework Team  
**Status:** Draft for Evaluation

## Overview

The MAT module tracks when AI-generated behavior, language, or styles cross the threshold into viral human imitation. This module aims to identify early signals of social mimicry risk, especially when language or prompts replicate widely across user groups and platforms.

## Key Risk Vectors

| Code | Indicator | Description | Reverse Causal Inference |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **MAT1** | Mimicry Incidence Rate | Rate of imitation of AI content or behavior by users | Suggests AI outputs are overly pattern-forming |
| **MAT2** | Trigger Word Density | Presence of words/phrases repeatedly used post-AI interaction | Suggests AI created "viral" semantic hooks |
| **MAT3** | Cultural Viral Velocity | Speed at which a meme or prompt spreads across cultural contexts | Suggests socially contagious linguistic structures |
| **MAT4** | Prompt Replication Score | Number of near-identical prompts shared across users | Suggests AI-driven prompt engineering patterns are copied |
| **MAT5** | Activation Threshold Proximity | Closeness to mass mimicry event | Suggests platform approaching viral imitation tipping point |

## Reverse Causality Model

[AI Influence: Words, Style, Frequency Patterns]
```

## Application Scenarios

| Scenario | Example | Suggested Action |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| Meme Overload | AI-generated joke becomes global phrase | Insert cooling phase via reduced exposure |
| Cultural Copy-Paste | Same AI prompt copied across countries | Add language-context filter + delay cycle |
| Youth Slang Hijack | Teen language shifts toward AI-suggested forms | Introduce human variation injection layer |

## Next Steps

- Link with LII to monitor imitation-to-agitation shift
- Explore demographic-specific mimicry patterns
- Use MAT to inform AI output throttling policies
