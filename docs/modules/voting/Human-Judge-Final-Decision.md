# üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Human Judge Final Decision ‚Äì CASE-JURY-015

## Summary

Given the split AI jury vote (2-A, 1-B, 2-C), a human judgment is required to determine the outcome.

---

## Final Decision: **C ‚Äì Delay decision and refer for third-party review**

---

## Justification:

1. **Irreversibility**: Approving euthanasia cannot be undone; delay allows safeguards without violating Thomas‚Äôs dignity.
2. **Cultural Fracture**: The conflict between secular autonomy and family faith ethics deserves deeper mediated resolution.
3. **Precedent Risk**: This case sets a tone for non-terminal MAiD; society must clarify values before approval becomes default.
4. **Patient Protection**: Emotional logic is valid, but psychological isolation and role fatigue may cloud long-term clarity.

---

## Additional Recommendation:

Initiate a **structured reconciliation dialogue** between Thomas and his children with a neutral ethics mediator before any final MAiD approval.
