Each AI jury member has reviewed all role briefs and submitted an independent vote with reasoning. Below is the breakdown.

---

### 🧠 AI Juror 1 – Fact-Centric Analyst
**Vote**: C – Delay decision, refer for further observation  
**Rationale**: Although autonomy is established, the lack of terminal illness and family distress necessitate deeper evaluation and safeguards.

### ⚖️ AI Juror 2 – Legalist
**Vote**: A – Approve euthanasia
