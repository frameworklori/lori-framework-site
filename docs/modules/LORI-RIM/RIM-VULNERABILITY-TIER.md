# RIM-VULNERABILITY-TIER – Risk Distribution in Civilizational Collapse

## 🎯 Purpose

To model how ecological collapse distributes survivability unequally across global populations, using a pyramid-structure vulnerability index.

## 🧬 Core Premise

In a climate-induced collapse scenario:
- Extinction is not simultaneous.
- Those with least resources, weakest infrastructure, and minimal political visibility will die first.
- The top 10% will delay collapse through technology and location-based privilege.
- The bottom 10% may already be undergoing silent attrition.

> “Survivability is no longer a species-wide trait — it is class-distributed and geopolitically gated.”

## 🔻 Tiered Collapse Risk Levels

| Tier | Description | Likely Outcome |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Tier 1** | Isolated, impoverished, high-risk zones (e.g. Sub-Saharan, island nations) | First deaths; undercounted |
| **Tier 2** | Urban poor in climate-vulnerable cities | Exposure, migration pressure |
| **Tier 3** | Emerging economies with limited mitigation systems | Infrastructural strain |
| **Tier 4** | Middle-class zones with adaptive capacity | Temporary delay, rising costs |
| **Tier 5** | Technocratic elite enclaves (e.g. domed cities, polar regions) | Last to fall, possibly post-collapse survivors |

## 🔬 Metrics Used

- Per capita access to water, food, energy
- Medical infrastructure per 1000 residents
- Ecological buffer (forests, elevation, rainfall)
- Political visibility in global aid channels
- LORI-UFI death silence signal overlay

---

## 🧭 Use Case

- Design climate justice policies that allocate survival resources equitably
- Expose false neutrality in "climate resilience" planning
- Predict collapse progression not in years, but in population strata
