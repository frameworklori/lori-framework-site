# Climate Resilience & Impact Matrix (RIM) – Scoring Logic

## Evaluation Dimensions
1. Productivity Loss (%)
2. Food Yield Reduction (%)
3. Water Stress Index (0–1)
4. Adaptation Capacity Index (0–1)

## Region Resilience Score (RRS)
```plaintext
RRS = (1 - ProductivityLoss%) × (1 - WaterStress) × AdaptationCapacity

Classification
RRS > 0.75: High resilience

RRS 0.50–0.75: Moderate resilience

RRS < 0.50: High vulnerability

Data Sources
FAO, IPCC, World Bank, local census and meteorological data
