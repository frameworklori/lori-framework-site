# Risk-Strata Mortality Map – Geospatial Risk Visualization for Climate-Induced Mortality

## 🧭 Purpose

To visually represent global regions' stratified mortality risks in the face of climate-induced ecological collapse, combining demographic fragility, infrastructure resilience, and predicted hazard exposure.

## 🌍 Methodology

- Data Layers:
- Population density and poverty index
- Infrastructure resilience score (water, shelter, health)
- Past 50-year disaster mortality rates
- Climate hazard frequency (wildfire, flood, drought, heatwave)
- Mortality Risk Tiers:
- 🔴 Tier 1 – Extremely High Risk (infrastructure collapse imminent)
- 🟠 Tier 2 – High Risk (high exposure, moderate infrastructure)
- 🟡 Tier 3 – Moderate Risk (moderate exposure, adaptive capacity uncertain)
- 🟢 Tier 4 – Low Risk (high adaptation, low exposure)
- Update Frequency:
- Updated annually with disaster + demographic datasets

## 🔍 Use Cases

- Identify regions needing immediate climate aid
- Visualize structural climate inequality
- Support international funding prioritization (e.g. Global Climate Fund)
- Aid migration modeling for climate refugees

## 🔐 Data Source Integrity

- All datasets must be peer-reviewed or open-government verified
- AI inference layers must include explainability tags
- Risk maps stored immutably on PublicClimateMemory.md
