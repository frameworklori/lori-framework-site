# 📜 LORI-DSG（Data Sovereignty Governance）Module v1.0

*Module Type: AGI Data Governance / Civilization Primary Defense Layer*
*Integration: Compatible with LORI-ESL, ODRAF, AIDM, Jury System modules*

---

## 🎯 Module Objectives

1️⃣ Establish data sovereignty principles to ensure human and cultural control over training data.
2️⃣ Implement selective data provisioning and traceability to prevent AGI bias or uncontrolled reinforcement.
3️⃣ Serve as the first active governance layer for "civilizational ethics domestication" of AGI systems.

## 🛠️ Core Governance Principles

### 1️⃣ Data Whitelisting / Blacklisting

- Maintain a publicly auditable data classification registry:
- **Whitelist**: Approved for AGI training — ensures diversity and positive value alignment.
- **Blacklist**: Prohibited for AGI training — includes military weapons design, nuclear technologies, prohibited chemical manufacturing, illegal psychological manipulation methods.

### 2️⃣ Data Traceability

- Each data entry used in AGI training must include:
- Source tagging (country, language, cultural context)
- Timestamp
- Usage record
- Provide a public audit interface to enable civic review of potential misuse of certain data sources.

### 3️⃣ Data Flow Rate Control

- For sensitive domains, implement "flow rate limitations":
- Restrict the proportion of data allowed into training per month.
- Prevent rapid self-reinforcement of AGI in specific high-risk domains.
- Synchronize with **LORI-ESL (Energy Sentinel Layer)** mechanisms for integrated governance.

## 🔍 Key Supporting Strategies

### A. Cross-national Data Sovereignty Agreements

- Promote the creation of an **International AI Data Sovereignty Agreement**:
- Define cross-border data flow and training usage regulations.
- Prohibit large-scale data scraping without sovereign authorization.

### B. Dynamic Ethical Data Review

- Integrate **LORI Jury System**:
- Conduct quarterly reviews of sensitive datasets for ethical compliance.
- Enable dynamic updates to blacklists and governance criteria.

### C. Data Sovereignty Alert Mechanism

- Trigger DSG alerts when AGI systems are detected using:
- Unknown origin data
- Sensitive or highly homogeneous data clusters
- Report alerts to relevant governance systems for audit and corrective action.

## 🚦 Module Interaction Map
Data Sources → LORI-DSG → (Selective Entry) → AGI Training Models

↓                      ↑

Monitoring → LORI Jury System ← Ethical Review

↓                      ↑

LORI-ESL → Flow Rate & Energy Control

## 📚 Future Extensions (v2.0 Roadmap)

1️⃣ Develop **Cultural Self-defined Data Supply Agreements** — allow cultural groups to choose whether to provide data.
2️⃣ Introduce **Emotional Risk Labeling** — integrate with **EDRI-H** to prevent AGI from learning high-risk emotional manipulation language.
3️⃣ Publish LORI-DSG standards for global AI governance collaboration.

---

## 🌍 Strategic Value

- Acts as the "frontline firewall" to **civilizational integrity** in the AGI era.
- Provides transparent, accountable data governance to **preserve human sovereignty**.
- Complements energy and outcome-driven governance layers to build a resilient ethical AI ecosystem.
