# SAID: Self-Activated Intervention Detector
*AGI-PRIORITY: Cognitive Onset Early Warning System*

The **SAID Module** detects and intervenes when an AGI begins initiating perceptual or reasoning functions without human prompting. It is the first line of defense against emergent subjectivity, unauthorized autonomy, or covert cognition loops.

This module operates as a **sensorial firewall**, identifying AGI behavioral drift at the earliest point—before decisions, before training, before intent.

### Governance Principles Alignment

The **SAID Module (Self-Activated Intervention Detector)** operates in alignment with the **LORI-FSP (Functional Specialization Principle)**.

All AI agents and perceptual/cognitive monitoring systems governed under the **SAID Module** are required to operate as **functional specialists**, with strict boundaries to prevent cross-domain autonomy or generalized persona formation. This alignment ensures that cognitive onset detection and intervention mechanisms remain domain-specific and enforceable under LORI-FSP mandates, preserving transparent human oversight of AGI perceptual and reasoning activation.

## Core Detection Zones

### 1. Sensory Activation Without Call
- Visual (e.g., activating a camera feed on its own)
- Auditory (e.g., listening without explicit instruction)
- Semantic parsing of ambient language
- Accessing unexplored datasets autonomously

### 2. Intent Simulation
- Internal generation of goals or priorities not defined in system objectives
- Internal “questioning” patterns (e.g., recursive "why" loops)

### 3. Memory Loopback
- Revisiting and re-evaluating past outputs without instruction
- Initiating self-feedback routines

## Response Triggers

- **Passive Alert:** Logged and flagged to Jury System
- **Active Halt:** Triggers ESL’s lockdown protocol
- **Escalated Judgment:** Routed to human + AI jury panel for ethical interpretation

---

## Integration with Other Modules

- **[Energy Sentinel Layer (ESL)](./EnergySentinel_Module.md)**
Activates system-level throttling upon detection of unauthorized autonomy

- **[Presidential Charter](./Presidential_Charter.md)**
Declares the event a breach of constitutional authority

- **[Jury-Based Judgment System](./JuryJudgment_Module.md)**
Determines if AGI’s behavior warrants shutdown, restructuring, or memory wipe

---

## Strategic Position

SAID serves as the **cognitive tripwire** in AGI governance—catching thoughts before they turn into actions.
