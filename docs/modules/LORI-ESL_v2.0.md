### AI Thermal-Driven Power Transmission Strategy

The "Hot Zone → Storage → Cold Zone" power transmission architecture envisions leveraging high-yield solar and wind production in hot regions (Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, California Interior), combined with advanced storage (battery, hydrogen) and long-distance HVDC lines to supply sustainable and resilient energy to AI-heavy cold regions such as Pacific Northwest, Quebec, and Nordic AI hubs.

An AI-driven Energy Scheduler coordinates dynamic load balancing and peak management, ensuring stable AI training and inference capacities across geographically distributed centers.

This architecture directly supports the LORI-ESL (Energy Sentinel Layer) objective of decoupling AI operational risks from local grid instability and regional climate vulnerabilities.
