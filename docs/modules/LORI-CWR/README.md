## ðŸ§­ Overview

The **LORI-CWR (Core Work of Resilience)** module identifies and protects essential human occupations that remain **irreplaceable in the AI era**. These professions are not just economic rolesâ€”they are **pillars of emotional continuity, embodied presence, ethical decision-making, and civilizational sustainability**.

Each role category reflects a domain where AI may assist, but never replace, the human being at the core.
