## 🧭 Module Overview

As AI and automation continue to penetrate all sectors of society, not all occupations can be replaced by algorithms, robotics, or data models. The **LORI-CWR** module is designed to identify, classify, and preserve a set of occupations that are fundamentally rooted in **embodied human intelligence, emotional responsibility, and ethical situational judgment**.

These roles are not only essential to functional economies—they are the **invisible scaffolding of social trust, lived compassion, and civilizational continuity**.

## 🔐 Core Principles

1. **Embodied Perception**
Tasks relying on human touch, sensory intuition, and immediate environmental responsiveness cannot be replaced by abstract reasoning or virtual inputs.

2. **Emotional Transmission**
Human-to-human care involves empathy, timing, and presence—none of which AI can replicate meaningfully or ethically.

3. **Ethical Responsibility**
Certain roles carry moral weight, accountability, and decision-making under uncertainty that cannot be automated or externally delegated.

4. **Contextual Adaptability**
Real-life environments are volatile, sensory-rich, and require fluid response—beyond the rigidity of models and code.
