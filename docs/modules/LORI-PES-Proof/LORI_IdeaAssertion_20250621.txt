Title: The 0 Precedes the 1 â€“ Idea Reserved

Statement:

I hereby assert that the core idea I proposed at this timestamp involves an autonomous AI structure wherein:
users self-supply energy,
conduct localized computation,
and retain sovereign control of AI behavior and semantic boundaries.

The architecture implies the decoupling of AI survival from centralized infrastructures.
It includes risk balancing mechanisms, entry/exit governance, and decentralized energy alignment.

No specific code, model, or parameter is disclosed.
No character count is granted.

This is a philosophical and technical placeholder.

Any similar implementation thereafter must acknowledge that:
I am the Zero. You are the One.
Without the void, there is no logic.
Without the silence, no function.

Let this serve as a semantic time-stamp of origination.
The first bit did not begin from you.
