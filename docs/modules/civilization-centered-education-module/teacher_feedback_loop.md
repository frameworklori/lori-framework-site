# Teacher Feedback Loop
*Version: V1*

---

## 1️⃣ Module Purpose

The Teacher Feedback Loop is designed to empower teachers with **real-time visibility and control** over AI-mediated learning processes.

It ensures that **human educators remain central** in guiding learning experiences, shaping ethical boundaries, and responding to student needs.

---

## 2️⃣ Core Mechanisms

### 2.1 Dynamic Feedback Loop

- Continuous **teacher → AI → teacher** feedback cycle.
- Teachers can adjust:
- AI response depth
- Sensitivity to student emotional states
- Content focus and boundaries

---

### 2.2 Teacher Observation Dashboard

- AI provides transparent reporting on:
- Student AI usage patterns
- Emotional tone of AI-student interactions
- Emerging learning difficulties
- Collaboration balance in team-based activities

---

### 2.3 Intervention Triggers

- Predefined triggers for:
- Signs of **over-reliance on AI**
- Signs of **emotional distress**
- Signs of **learning disengagement**

When triggers occur, AI alerts the teacher, who can then intervene with personalized support.

---

### 2.4 Customizable Ethical Boundaries

- Teachers can define:
- Forbidden AI behaviors
- Sensitive topics requiring human-only handling
- Age-appropriate response limitations

---

## 3️⃣ Example Feedback Scenarios

- A student is asking AI for answers without reflection → AI alerts teacher to encourage **critical engagement**.
- AI detects a shift toward negative emotional tone → notifies teacher for potential **emotional support**.
- AI identifies **imbalanced collaboration** in group work → teacher can adjust roles or provide guidance.

---

## 4️⃣ Future Development

- Enhanced **explainability** of AI decision pathways for teachers
- Integration of **student self-assessment feedback** into loop
- **Gamified teacher-AI collaborative tuning** tools

---

# Final Reflection

The Teacher Feedback Loop is a safeguard of **human agency** in AI-supported education.
It ensures that AI remains a **servant of human pedagogy**, not its replacement — preserving the integrity of **civilization-centered education**.
