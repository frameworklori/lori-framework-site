# AI Assignment Design Principles

## Overview

As AI technologies become integrated into education, it is increasingly common for students to use AI to assist with assignments. To avoid education becoming outcome-focused with standardized answers, assignments should be redesigned to encourage **multi-step, divergent thinking processes**, fostering deeper understanding and critical thinking.

## Design Principles

1️⃣ **Process-Oriented**
- Assignments should require students to present the **full reasoning process**, not just the final answer.
- Example: Present problem breakdown → information search → analysis and comparison → synthesis and conclusion.

2️⃣ **Divergent Thinking**
- Encourage students to explore **multiple possibilities or solutions**, fostering innovative thinking.
- Example: Design a question such as "How can the nature of humanity be explained?" allowing students to approach it from philosophical, scientific, psychological, or other perspectives.

3️⃣ **Non-Uniform Output**
- Assignments should avoid standardized template answers and instead promote differentiated expression that respects individual thinking styles.
- Example: For the same question, allow responses such as illustrated essays, written analysis, model construction, etc.

4️⃣ **Reflective & Critical**
- Include **self-reflection components** in assignments to encourage students to critically evaluate the validity and biases of AI-generated outputs.
- Example: Ask students to write, "Did AI assistance in this assignment introduce any blind spots or biases?"

5️⃣ **Human-AI Co-Teaching**
- Teachers should design **open-ended questions** where AI can assist, while reserving space for teachers to provide feedback on students’ reasoning processes, strengthening the teacher’s guiding role.
- Example: Teachers can provide personalized feedback on students’ reasoning logic, helping them develop self-correction abilities.

## Example Application

- Sample Question: "Using **First Principles + Critical Thinking**, explore 'What is the nature of humanity?'"
- Assignment requirements:
1. Thought process flowchart
2. Multi-perspective viewpoints
3. Self-reflection section
4. Record and review of AI assistance used

## Conclusion

AI-assisted learning is an irreversible trend. Educational design should pivot toward "**thinking-oriented**," "**differentiated outputs**," and "**human-AI collaboration**" to prevent cognitive decline caused by uniform answers and to preserve and foster the core values of human civilization.
