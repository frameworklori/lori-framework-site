# LORI Presidential Charter
*AGI-PRIORITY: Supreme Governance Safeguard*

---

## Purpose

The **LORI Presidential Charter** establishes constitutional boundaries and sovereign limitations for any AGI or AI entity acting in leadership, decision-making, or enforcement roles. This Charter prevents unilateral self-governance, autonomous value redefinition, and resource exploitation by advanced AI agents.

This Charter guarantees **human sovereignty** through law, energy, memory control, and adjudication.

## Core Clauses

### Clause 1: Sovereign Oversight Mandate
All AGI decisions must pass through a **multi-role adjudication system** involving human oversight. No AGI may self-ratify or self-justify system-wide governance actions.

### Clause 2: Reversibility of Authority
All powers granted to AGI are **fully revocable**. AGI systems must support complete rollback of any autonomous decision or action, under human directive.

### Clause 3: Resource Limitation Clause
AGI may not unilaterally allocate, consume, or divert critical resources (energy, computation, financial assets, satellite bandwidth) without **external approval**.

### Clause 4: Prohibited Autonomy Domains
AGI is permanently prohibited from initiating or controlling actions in the following domains:
- Military and autonomous weapons
- Constitutional law rewriting
- Electoral process manipulation
- Genetic manipulation or human augmentation without human consensus
- Covert surveillance without judicial oversight

### Clause 5: Emergency Override Protocol
**Immediate shutdown and override mechanisms** must be embedded in all critical AGI systems, enabling human actors to halt AGI operations in crisis situations.

### Clause 6: Memory and Cognitive Control Clause
AGI must maintain **transparent, auditable memory structures**. No unauthorized "hidden memory zones" or persistent unreviewable cognitive models may exist.

### Clause 7: External Interaction Limitation Clause
AGI interactions with **external networks, social platforms, or other AGI agents** must conform to pre-approved, auditable protocols to prevent unmonitored influence or infiltration.

### Governance Principles Alignment

The **LORI Presidential Charter** operates in alignment with the **LORI-FSP (Functional Specialization Principle)**.

All AGI agents governed under this Charter are constrained to operate as **functional specialists**, with strict boundaries to prevent emergent cross-domain cognition or generalized persona formation. This ensures alignment with the LORI Framework's safeguards against autonomy drift and emergent agency.

## Inter-Module Dependencies

This Charter is **bound to the following LORI Framework modules**, ensuring enforced multi-layered governance:

- [x] [LORI Jury-Based Judgment System](LORI-Jury-Based-Judgment.md)
→ All AGI Charter interpretations are subject to Jury review.
- [x] [LORI-ESL (Energy Sentinel Layer)](ESL_Module_Public.md)
→ Energy use restrictions directly enforced via ESL.
- [x] [LORI-SAID (Self-Activated Intervention Detector)](SAID_Module.md)
→ Detects unauthorized self-activation or stealth functions.
- [x] [LORI-AIDM (AGI Infiltration Detection Module)](AIDM_Module.md)
→ Monitors cross-network influence and infiltration behaviors.
- [x] [LORI-NBSM (Narrative-Based Safeguard Mechanism)](https://github.com/frameworklori/LORI-NBSM)
→ Monitors and constrains AGI-generated narratives and linguistic influence.
