**Module Name:** Opportunity Cost Reversal Engine

## ðŸ“˜ Module Purpose

OCRE is designed to reverse the structural disincentives that prevent undocumented immigrants from seeking legal status. It models financial, social, and behavioral costs and simulates policy levers that can shift the balance toward rational legalization.

---

## ðŸ§® Core Model Logic

> "People do not legalize because doing so costs more than remaining undocumented."

OCRE uses a dynamic scoring model to simulate how policies can invert that equation.

## ðŸ”§ Key Levers & Simulation Fields

| Factor | Disincentive | Reversal Mechanism |
|--------|---------------|--------------------|
| Tax Shock | Immediate full taxation upon legalization | Phased tax ramp-up over 3 years |
| Loss of Benefits | Ineligibility for certain aid once legal | Social credit incentives + targeted subsidies |
| Exposure Risk | Sudden government tracking | Data firewall + privacy buffer during adjustment phase |

## ðŸ“Š Output Metrics

- `Net Benefit Score`: Legalization benefit vs. cost delta  
- `Legitimacy Readiness Index`: Combined with LORI-CIM outputs  
- Simulation visualizations over 5â€“10 year adoption periods

---

## ðŸ§© Use Cases

- Drafting new immigration reform bills  
- Designing non-punitive legalization pipelines  
- Analyzing public trust elasticity in migrant-heavy regions
