# Conformity Effect Module

## Purpose

The **Conformity Effect Module (CEM)** analyzes the emergence and amplification of conformity behaviors within digital societies. It detects how algorithmic reinforcement, emotional stimuli, and cultural symbols influence individuals to align their values, language, and trust with the dominant group or narrative.

This module serves as a key intersection point for emotional dependency, AI manipulation detection, and group behavior modeling.

## Key Indicators

| Metric | Abbreviation | Description |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Mimicry Activation Threshold** | `MAT` | The minimum percentage of similar social inputs (e.g., comments, reactions) required to trigger group imitation behavior. |
| **Cultural Contagion Velocity** | `CCV` | The speed at which imitation spreads within a population, similar to a viral R-value. |
| **Conformity Drift Index** | `CDI` | Degree of deviation from initial belief or discourse as group alignment intensifies. |
| **Echo Reinforcement Score** | `ERS` | Measures how strongly AI algorithms amplify conformity signals (e.g., similar wording, visual motifs). |

---

## Risk Levels

### Red Alert Conditions:
- `CCV > 0.8` and `MAT < 0.2` (rapid spread from minority signal)
- `CDI > 70` (high value or linguistic drift)
- `ERS > 0.9` (high algorithmic echo amplification)

### Orange Alert Conditions:
- `0.5 < CCV ≤ 0.8` and `CDI > 50`

### Green Zone:
- `CCV < 0.3` and `CDI < 30`

## Use Cases

- Viral video comment sections generating artificial consensus.
- Repetitive political language fostering ideological alignment.
- AI-boosted influencer mimicry altering user identity perception.
- Crisis-driven emotional convergence creating behavioral panic loops.

## Visual Models

### 1. Imitation vs Infection Heatmap

This heatmap visualizes the relationship between imitation sensitivity (inverse MAT) and infection speed (CCV).
It helps identify high-risk zones where conformity behaviors can rapidly spread with minimal resistance.

- **Y-axis**: CCV (Cultural Contagion Velocity)
- **Color Scale**: Risk zone from Green (low) to Red (critical)

### 2. Trust Drift Arrow Diagram

Illustrates movement of collective trust from diverse nodes to a centralized source over time.
