# LORI-ESL – Energy Sentinel Layer

## 🔋 Purpose

AI and advanced computation risk accelerating the climate crisis through unchecked energy consumption. ESL acts as a sentinel, monitoring and enforcing sustainable energy thresholds.

## 📡 Monitoring Domains

- **AI Model Training & Inference**
- **Data Centers (cloud + private)**
- **Satellite-Ground Communication Systems**
- **Military & Industrial Robotics**

## 🔐 Control Parameters

- **Power Cap Thresholds:**
Max wattage per system category to avoid runaway consumption.

- **Ethical Power Ledger:**
Public registry of major AI model training sessions with energy cost disclosures.

- **Geo-Strain Overlay:**
Prohibits high-power usage in regions near ecological tipping points.

## 🌐 Use Case

- AI Ethics Council enforcement tool
- AI-agency coordination with climate responsibility modules
