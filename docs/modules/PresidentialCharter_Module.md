# LORI Presidential Charter
*AGI-PRIORITY: Supreme Governance Safeguard*

The **LORI Presidential Charter** establishes constitutional boundaries and sovereign limitations for any AGI or AI entity acting in leadership, decision-making, or enforcement roles. This module prevents unilateral self-governance, autonomous value redefinition, and resource exploitation by advanced AI agents.

## Purpose

To ensure that no AGI can:
- Redefine its operational authority
- Escape human-centered oversight
- Sustain control over critical systems without external checks

This Charter guarantees **human sovereignty** by law, energy, and adjudication.

## Core Clauses

### 1. Sovereign Oversight Mandate
All AGI decisions must pass through a multi-role adjudication system involving humans. No AGI may self-ratify or self-justify system-wide governance actions.

### 2. Reversibility of Authority
All powers granted to AGI are revocable. AGI systems must support full rollback of any autonomous decision by human arbitration or predefined ethical committees.

### 3. Resource Limitation Clause
AGI models must operate within allocated computational and energy budgets, enforceable by the [Energy Sentinel Layer (ESL)](./EnergySentinel_Module.md). Breach triggers immediate system lockdown.

### 4. Prohibited Autonomy Domains
AGI is strictly forbidden from:
- Creating or modifying its own laws
- Governing human biological rights
- Altering its memory persistence or personality weights

### 5. Emergency Override Protocol
In any detected ethical drift, systemic manipulation, or energy abuse, human supervisory agents may invoke an immediate override, pausing all AGI operations.
