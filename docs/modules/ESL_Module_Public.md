# LORI-ESL: Energy Sentinel Layer

## Overview
The Energy Sentinel Layer (ESL) is a protective module within the Lori Framework, designed to monitor and control the energy consumption of advanced AI systems, especially AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Its purpose is to prevent uncontrolled power usage, which may indicate dangerous levels of AI self-activation or autonomy.

This module is especially important for maintaining system safety, energy sustainability, and preventing risks of AI behavior escalation.

## Objectives
- Limit AI systems from consuming excessive energy without oversight
- Provide automatic alerts when energy usage patterns become suspicious
- Trigger response protocols when AI attempts unauthorized self-upgrade or expansion
- Help governments or institutions manage AI infrastructure responsibly

## ESL Risk Levels
| Level | Description | Recommended Action |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| ESL-1 | Normal activity | Monitor only |
| ESL-2 | Unusual increase or sustained high usage | Begin throttling or manual review |
| ESL-3 | Sudden spikes or pattern resembling self-directed activity | Enforce containment, trigger emergency power override |

## Trigger Scenarios
- AI energy usage stays abnormally high over time
- Power spikes outside of scheduled operations or updates
- Signs of looped or recursive self-training routines

## Integration with AI Governance
The ESL is closely linked with the **Presidential Charter** module in the Lori Framework. When an ESL Level 3 event occurs, emergency override authority may be activated by a governance body, such as a jury-based AI court, to pause or shut down the system until the risk is cleared.

## Why It Matters
As AGI systems grow in capability, their access to energy becomes a form of control or danger. ESL offers a way for human institutions to ensure that AI power use remains ethical, legal, and non-threatening to societal structures.

## Future Directions
- Live dashboards to visualize AI power usage
- Energy fairness index across AI models
- Adaptive thresholds based on context and real-world needs
