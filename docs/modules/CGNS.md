# 🏛️ Co-Governance Node System (CGNS)
*Module Type: Decentralized Governance / Ethical Participation Layer*
📅 Proposed: 2025-07-06 ｜ Proposed by: LORI Framework

---

## 🧭 Purpose

To prevent any AI system (such as Grok) from being governed solely by its creators, this module introduces a **distributed oversight mechanism** composed of human-coordinated semantic reviewers.

---

## 🧠 Initial Node Roles

1. **Linguistic Bias Auditor**
2. **Public Sentiment Curator**
3. **Emotional Feedback Mediator**
4. **Historical-Ethical Consistency Reviewer**
5. **Model Update Dispute Arbitrator**

---

## 🔄 Functions

- Node voting or feedback may influence language alignment scores
- Nodes may issue “semantic veto” flags requiring transparency logs
- Future expansions may include multilingual or cultural representation balancing

---

## 📎 Status
⚪ No implementation announced yet by Grok or xAI
