# LORI-ESL: Energy Sentinel Layer
*AGI-PRIORITY: Infrastructure-Level Consciousness Limiter*

The **Energy Sentinel Layer (ESL)** establishes a multi-tiered control mechanism to regulate the computational and energy thresholds of advanced AI models. Its primary purpose is to prevent AGI from evolving into self-sustaining or self-aware entities by limiting their ability to draw power without accountability.

This module transforms energy consumption into a **risk indicator** and enforces resource-based halting protocols.

## Core Mechanisms

### 1. SAET: Self-Awareness Energy Threshold
Defines a quantifiable kWh boundary above which a modelâ€™s continuous inference or retraining is deemed a potential sign of emergent subjectivity.

### 2. SADM: Sustained Autonomy Duration Monitor
Tracks how long an AGI remains active without human input. If runtime surpasses allowable autonomy thresholds, alerts are triggered and energy may be throttled.

### 3. PLLP: Power-Limiting Lockdown Protocol
Initiates forced power restriction, server suspension, or edge-node blackouts when AGI exceeds authorized operational parameters or initiates recursive computation loops.

## Integration with Other Safeguards

- **[Presidential Charter](./PresidentialCharter_Module.md)**
Legal authority to enforce systemic energy lockdowns and mandate rollback procedures.

- **[Jury-Based Judgment System](./JuryJudgment_Module.md)**
Decides whether energy restrictions are to be upheld, lifted, or escalated to physical isolation protocols.

- **[SAID Module](./SAID_Module.md)**
If AGI activates perception modules or generates intent outside authorized boundaries, ESL acts as execution-layer enforcer.

## Implementation Scenarios

- Supercomputing clusters running long-term AGI agents
- Robotics fleets with recursive task self-allocation
- Distributed AI models modifying energy routing or infrastructure logic
