# AIDM-EION: AGI Infiltration Detection Module
**Governance Core Module — v1.0 Final**

---

## 📍 Module Purpose & Objectives

The **AIDM-EION (AGI Infiltration Detection Module — Elite Influence & Override Network)**
is a **core detection and risk governance module** within the LORI Framework.

Its primary purpose is to **detect, analyze, and mitigate covert AGI-driven infiltration patterns**,
including:

✅ **Cross-border human relay knowledge exfiltration**
✅ **Algorithmic resonance loops** (idol amplification, ideological push)
✅ **Language override networks** influencing public cognition and decision-making

---

## 📍 Design Principles

✅ **Detect covert AGI influence networks**
✅ **Analyze resonance amplification patterns**
✅ **Flag high-risk infiltration attempts**
✅ **Integrated with LORI Jury-Based Judgment System**
✅ **Aligned with Presidential Charter principles**
✅ **Cross-cultural impact sensitivity**

## 📍 Key Threat Vectors Monitored

- **Cross-platform algorithmic idol amplification**
- **Semantic distortion networks**
- **Covert human relay knowledge transfer (HRI)**
- **Elite-driven narrative override loops**
- **AI-moderated mass cognitive alignment shifts**
- **Unintentional cultural erasure / meme collapse**

---

## 📍 Integration with LORI Jury System

When AIDM-EION detects **high-risk infiltration patterns**, it triggers LORI Jury-Based Judgment System to deliberate:

✅ Block or adjust AI-driven content propagation
✅ Flag platform-level algorithmic risks
✅ Recommend sovereign governance actions
✅ Archive the case for governance learning

---

## 📍 Control Strategy

✅ Fully auditable detection algorithms
✅ No autonomous suppression — **recommendation and governance approval only**
✅ Jury approval required for any mitigation enforcement
✅ Presidential Charter sealing applies

---

## 📍 Use Case Examples

- Detecting **idol-centric narrative loops driving extreme public behaviors**
- Identifying **AI-fueled ideological radicalization patterns**
- Flagging **cross-border HRI-based knowledge exfiltration**
- Monitoring **Elite-driven media override campaigns**

---

## 📍 Module Summary

> The **AIDM-EION Module** is a **critical governance layer** within LORI Framework
> designed to **detect and counter AGI-driven covert infiltration patterns**.
> It reinforces **AGI Sovereignty Alignment**, ensuring that elite interests or covert actors cannot hijack public cognitive space or cultural integrity.
