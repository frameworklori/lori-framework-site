## üõ°Ô∏è Ethical Constraints

- **No automatic rejection**: CCC modules are used to enhance transparency and civic verification, not to create exclusion.
- **Must be paired with alternatives**: Jurisdictions must offer free/remote civic education and volunteer tracks as alternatives.
- **Auditable & Rights-Protected**: All CCC-based decisions must be appealable and recorded within the LORI Jury Framework.
