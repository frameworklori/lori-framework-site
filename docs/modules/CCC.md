# 🏛️ LORI-CCC – Citizenship Commitment Criteria  
**Module for Democratic Qualification Integrity within the LORI Framework**

---

## 📘 Overview

LORI-CCC (Citizenship Commitment Criteria) is a structural module designed to enhance the democratic legitimacy of birthright citizenship systems by incorporating civic responsibility, cultural participation, and re-entry risk monitoring.

This module responds to rising concerns of strategic abuse—where individuals acquire citizenship through birth, develop values in non-democratic systems, and later return to influence or extract resources from democratic societies.

## 🧩 Submodules

| Code | Name | Function |
|------|------|----------|
| `CCC-FPT` | Foreign Parent Taxation | Requires documentation of tax contribution or civic participation from non-citizen parents at the time of the child’s birth. Without it, the child's citizenship enters a "Delayed Activation" status until adulthood review. |
| `CCC-CAP` | Cultural Affiliation Phase | Mandates a minimum of 3 years of education and community participation in the citizenship-granting country before the age of 18. Ensures the child develops shared democratic values. |
| `CCC-RIM` | Re-Entry Influence Monitor | Monitors individuals who re-enter the country as adults and take positions in sensitive domains (e.g., government, tech, academia). Flags potential cultural mismatch or systemic infiltration risk. |

## 🔁 Integration

LORI-CCC interacts with the following systems:

- `LORI-JURY` → Used in adjudicating fairness and ethical legitimacy of citizenship claims  
- `LORI-AIDM` → Triggers AI monitoring when re-entry poses narrative or ideological risk  
- `LORI-TRUST` → Integrates trust drift scoring across individual and parental inputs  
- `LORI-ODRAF` → Simulates long-term outcome risks of strategic identity manipulation

## 📌 Notes

This module does not abolish birthright citizenship.  
It **re-anchors it to responsibility**, ensuring it remains sustainable in a globally interconnected but ideologically fractured world.
