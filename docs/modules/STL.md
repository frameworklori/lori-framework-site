# 📊 Semantic Transparency Log (STL)
*Module Type: Language Accountability / Ethical Auditing*
📅 Proposed: 2025-07-06 ｜ Proposed by: LORI Framework

---

## 🧭 Purpose

The STL module ensures that all large-scale language models (such as Grok) log their **semantic reasoning chains**, **source origins**, and **projected affective impacts** in a format that allows public and expert review.

---

## 🔍 Core Components

- **Semantic Chain Tracker:** Logs key reasoning steps, assumptions, and language pivots
- **Source Trace Index:** Maps each major response to attributed or inferred knowledge sources
- **Linguistic Resonance Score (LRS):** Evaluates potential emotional amplification or narrative volatility

---

## 📘 Implementation Notes

- Every 100 responses → 1 STL summary log
- Outputs should be publicly accessible (or via API)
- Integrates with CGNS nodes for review and challenge
