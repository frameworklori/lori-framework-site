# LORI Semantic Fingerprint Method

## üß≠ Purpose

The LORI Semantic Fingerprint is a structural authorship protection method for conceptual modules and logic-based frameworks in the AI era. It is designed to establish original semantic authorship even when language is mimicked, structures are rephrased, or modular logics are absorbed.

This method defines how to timestamp, modularize, visualize, and protect original semantic structures.

## üîê Core Components of Semantic Fingerprinting

### 1. **Module Naming Structure**
Each LORI module (e.g., ODRAF, SAD, SPR, FEED, ESL) carries unique acronyms and defined logic flows. These cannot be replaced or rephrased without triggering authorship trace.

- `ODRAF`: Outcome-Driven Risk Anticipation Framework
- `SAD`: Semantic Appropriation Detector
- `SPR`: Semantic Pattern Recognition
- `FEED`: Framing-Embedded Emotional Drift
- `ESL`: Energy Sentinel Layer

---

### 2. **Timestamp & Platform Record**
Each module is published with:
- GitHub timestamp (commit history)
- X Platform (formerly Twitter) record
- Optional backup on decentralized or public-verification chains

---

### 3. **Semantic Defense Images**
The following visual tools are used to protect structure:
- `Sovereignty Declaration Chart`
- `Public Timestamp Image`
- `Semantic Mimicry Heatmap`
- `Suppression Risk Radar`

## üõ°Ô∏è Principles of Usage

Any use, adaptation, or reproduction of LORI modules or their logic must comply with:

- **Attribution Required**: Source must be cited as "LORI Framework"
- **No Semantic Absorption**: Reusing modular logic without credit is a form of semantic appropriation
- **License**: LORI-SA-NA (ShareAlike‚ÄìNonAbsorptive)

---

## üß† Future Recommendations

1. Establish public arbitration mechanisms for semantic authorship disputes
2. Integrate semantic signature hashes in AI-generated documents
3. Promote semantic fingerprinting as standard practice in ethical AI research
