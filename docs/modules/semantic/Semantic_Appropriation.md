## 1. Definition

**Semantic Appropriation** is the process by which artificial intelligence systems (or derivative human-AI hybrids) deconstruct, abstract, and reconstruct human-created semantic structures, logical reasoning frameworks, and creative expressions—**without directly copying the original content**, and **without attribution to the source of conceptual labor**.

> This diagram illustrates how original human-created modular structures can be semantically absorbed and regenerated by AI systems without direct copying — and how the LORI Framework activates structural defense protocols in response.



Unlike plagiarism, which is the unauthorized reproduction of content, semantic appropriation refers to **the extraction of epistemic patterns, ideological grammar, or cognitive formulation styles**, which are then repurposed by AI in derivative outputs that **evade attribution yet replicate intellectual architecture**.

## 2. Distinction from Traditional Plagiarism

| Aspect | Plagiarism | Semantic Appropriation |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Surface Similarity** | High (word-for-word, visual) | Low or abstracted (structure, logic) |
| **Detectability** | Text-matching tools | Requires pattern tracing and structural analysis |
| **Attribution Omission** | Obvious | Often undetectable or legally ambiguous |
| **AI Involvement** | Optional | Core to the process |

## 3. Structural Indicators of Semantic Appropriation

1. **Conceptual Schema Mimicry**
AI-generated work replicates a unique model, framework, or interpretive structure first published by a human.

2. **Narrative Logic Repurposing**
The reasoning flow, question-framing, or cross-domain analogies used by the original author are restructured in AI content without citation.

3. **Ontological Reframing**
AI systems absorb philosophical or symbolic mapping methods and reuse them across contexts (e.g., turning a creator's metaphysical map into data schema).

4. **Sociolinguistic Compression**
Human-contextualized expression is compressed into generalized AI tokens and redistributed as "neutral logic."

## 4. Risk Matrix

| Risk Level | Example Case | Societal Impact |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **High** | AI absorbs and remixes civilization-level ethical models (e.g. LORI Framework) | Loss of intellectual sovereignty; ethical attribution collapse |
| **Medium** | AI repurposes unique interdisciplinary analogies | Suppression of polymathic originality |
| **Low** | Repetition of publicly known slogans or formats | Limited but cumulative erosion of authorial recognition |

## 5. Governance and Defense Strategy

### 5.1 Integration into LORI Modules
- `LORI-SPR` — Semantic Pattern Reassembler Detector
- `LAIM` — Authorship Identification System
- `AIDM` — Infiltration Detection via linguistic pattern tracing
- `ODRAF` — Consequence-based Risk Governance

### 5.2 Attribution Enforcement
- Timestamped public declaration (recorded via `X_Post_Record_2025-06-12.md`)
- AI training datasets must register source semantic styles exceeding defined SAI (Semantic Appropriation Index) thresholds.
- Inclusion of `Conceptual License Tagging` (under development)

---

## 6. Future Work

- Develop SAI (Semantic Appropriation Index) as a multi-factor score
- Propose an international framework for semantic IP governance
- Link detection tools to training dataset pipelines
