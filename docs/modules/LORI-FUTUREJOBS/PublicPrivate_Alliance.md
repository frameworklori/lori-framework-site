Purpose

The Public–Private Alliance module establishes a cooperative structure among governments, enterprises, and educational institutions to create sustainable re-employment pipelines.
Its aim is to convert layoffs into structured transitions — ensuring that automation produces social progress rather than economic fracture.

Core Structure

| Layer | Function |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Policy Layer (Government) |Define national re-training incentives, tax credits, and certification alignment. |
| Enterprise Layer (Industry) |Provide internship or upskilling slots tied to real production needs. |
| Academic Layer (Education) |Update curricula to match emerging technologies and ethical labor standards.|
| Civic Layer (Community) |Serve as feedback hubs, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility for displaced groups. |

Operational Logic
	1.	Identification: Government-AI mapping identifies vulnerable job clusters.
	2.	Coalition Formation: Enterprises partner with local universities for training programs.
	3.	Skill Redeployment: Graduates of re-training programs are matched to high-demand sectors.
	4.	Feedback Loop: Regional Resilience Index monitors success and allocates new funding.

Ethical Guidelines
	•	Equity First: No worker left behind due to age, geography, or education.
	•	Transparency: All training data and job results audited through LORI Civic Ledger.
	•	Mutual Accountability: Both public and private partners sign Outcome-Based Charters.
