Purpose

The Capability Map module defines how individual skills, behavioral traits, and adaptive abilities align with the new economic landscape of the AI era.
It serves as a semantic bridge between what a worker can do today and what the evolving job ecosystem requires tomorrow.

By visualizing these transitions, this map allows policymakers, HR systems, and AI models to recognize hidden potential and design non-linear career pathways.

Conceptual Overview

| Dimension  | Description |Example|
|-----------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|Foundational Skills|Cognitive and behavioral abilities that remain stable across jobs.|Communication, Critical Thinking|
|Applied Skills|Technical or procedural abilities used in specific industries.|Machine Operation, Data Entry|
|Adaptive Traits|Learning agility, resilience, and emotional intelligence.|Receptivity to AI tools, Problem-solving under uncertainty|
|Emergent Capabilities|Cross-domain synthesis skills that merge human creativity with AI precision.|Prompt Engineering, Ethical Mediation, System integration|

Explanation:
	1.	Worker Profile data (CVs, psychometrics, performance records) enters the AI engine.
	2.	Capability Extraction Engine identifies overlapping strengths between jobs.
	3.	Skill–Trait Fusion integrates soft skills with hard technical competencies.
	4.	Capability Mapping Matrix produces a dynamic visualization of transferable value.
	5.	Outputs feed into both the Resilience Index and the Skill-Upgrade Pipeline, ensuring policy-level insight and individual benefit.

Technical Components

|Module  |Function |Data Source|
|-----------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|Capability Extraction Engine|Uses NLP & ontology-based classification to group skill tokens.|CVs, job databases|
|Skill–Trait Fusion Model|Connects psychological profiles to learning and adaptability metrics.|AI_Skills_ReEvaluation module|
|Mapping Matrix|3D relational map between traits, skills, and potential job clusters.|Training DB, ResilienceIndex|
|Feedback Layer|Monitors progression after training or redeployment.|PublicPrivate_Alliance|

Practical Application
	•	Governments can identify sectors with underutilized skill clusters.
	•	Companies can design cross-role training programs to retain displaced staff.
	•	Individuals can visualize career growth paths instead of job loss gaps.

Example:

A logistics worker with “pattern recognition” + “mechanical aptitude” → mapped to renewable energy maintenance through minimal retraining.

Ethical and Social Rationale

The LORI Capability Map rejects reductionist “skill replacement” models.
Instead, it advocates for skill reconfiguration — affirming that every worker carries transferable human capital that AI cannot erase, only amplify.

“Human capability is not a static inventory; it’s an evolving ecosystem of value.”

Output Integration
	•	Feeds resilience data to ResilienceIndex.md
	•	Supplies learning pathways to SkillUpgrade_Pipeline.md
	•	Updates organizational dashboards via PublicPrivate_Alliance.md
