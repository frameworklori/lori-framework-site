## Module Title
AI Liability & Governance Framework  

---

## 1. Module Overview
This module establishes a responsibility and governance system for human-AI collaboration. It aims to resolve ambiguity when AI systems are involved in decision-making, preventing “blame shifting” onto AI and ensuring that human agency remains accountable.

---

## 2. Problem Statement: Ambiguity of Blame in Human-AI Systems
- When AI makes or executes decisions, accountability becomes diffuse.
- Operators may deny responsibility by attributing errors to AI systems.
- Legal frameworks and organizational protocols often lag behind this complexity.

**Key Challenge**:  
> Who is responsible when an AI system “acts” on behalf of a human, but the result causes harm, loss, or ethical violations?

## 3. RACI Matrix: AI Lifecycle Roles & Responsibilities

| Phase               | Responsible        | Accountable         | Consulted        | Informed          |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Data Collection     | Data Engineers     | Chief Data Officer  | Legal Team       | Compliance Unit   |
| Model Training      | ML Developers      | AI Lead Architect   | Risk Analysts    | QA Unit           |
| Model Deployment    | DevOps Engineers   | CTO / CIO           | Ethics Board     | Security Team     |
| Operational Use     | AI Operator        | Business Owner      | UX Designers     | Users / Public    |
| Failure Response    | Incident Manager   | Legal Team          | Public Relations | Regulatory Agency |

## 4. AI-Human Decision Boundary Typologies

| Type                      | Description                                                | Responsibility Weight |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| AI-Only Decision          | AI acts without human review                               | Developer + Auditor    |
| Human-in-the-Loop         | AI suggests, human finalizes                               | Operator               |
| Human-on-the-Loop         | AI acts unless human overrides                             | Shared Responsibility  |
| AI-as-Adviser             | AI gives recommendations only                              | Human Decision-Maker   |
| Hybrid Cognitive Decision | AI and human jointly generate solution                     | Context Dependent      |

## 5. Failure Attribution Flowchart

[Start]  
   ↓  
[Incident Occurs]  
   ↓  
[Log Trace: Command Origin → AI Input → Inference Log]  
   ↓  
[Was Final Action Human Authorized?]──No──▶ AI-Only → Developer Responsible  
            │  
           Yes  
            ↓  
[Was Human Misled by Inadequate AI Explanation?]──Yes──▶ Shared Responsibility  
            │  
           No  
            ↓  
→ Human Operator Fully Responsible

## 6. Third-Party Audit and Logging Mechanism

- All AI deployments should have:
  - Immutable Decision Logs (Ledger or Snapshot)
  - Explanation Metadata
  - Periodic External Audits
  - Trigger Alert Systems for High-Stakes Decisions

> 🔗 Linked module: `SAID.md`, `ODRAF.md`, `ExplainabilityKit.md`

---

## 7. Role-Based Governance Controls

- Define **Authorization Tiers**:
  - Tier 1: AI Cannot Act Without Human Approval (default)
  - Tier 2: AI May Act With Audit Trail & Post-Hoc Justification
  - Tier 3: Fully Autonomous Actions Only in Contained Environments

- Assign **Governance Stakeholders**:
  - AI System Owners
  - Risk Committees
  - Ethical Oversight Panels

## 9. Implementation Roadmap

- 🧪 **Phase 1**: Internal RACI mapping and risk inventory
- 🔍 **Phase 2**: Logging + Explainability infrastructure
- ⚖️ **Phase 3**: Independent auditing procedures
- 📘 **Phase 4**: Staff training + ethical SOP activation
