# Module: Resonance Loop Detection

## Function
Detects recursive amplification loops across language, emotion, and identity dimensionsâ€”particularly in idol-related discourse, political slogans, and emotionally loaded memes.

## Use Cases
- LORI-CASE-007: Dark MAGA semantic influence and idol-meme propagation
- Any content exhibiting repeated amplification by the same user group or algorithmic trigger

## Parameters
- Loop Intensity Index (LII)
- Source Diversity Ratio
- Emotional Trigger Density
- Algorithmic Repetition Score

## Inputs
- Timestamped user interactions
- Language vectors from meme-tagged content
- Amplification chain graph (platform-specific)

## Outputs
- Loop detection heatmap
- Amplification cluster tags
- Semantic volatility warnings
