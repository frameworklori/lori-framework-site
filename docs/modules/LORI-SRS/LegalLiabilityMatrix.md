## Final Judgment (Updated):

This jury hereby declares:

> **The U.S. Second Amendment retains conditional legitimacy as a last-resort mechanism for democratic self-defense in the absence of fully democratized AI governance systems.**

However, the jury emphasizes the following mandatory conditions:

1. **Stricter identity verification and supervision protocols** for all firearm owners;
2. **Mandatory accountability of legal guardians** in any firearm incidents involving minors;
3. Progressive integration of **AI-assisted tracking systems** for ballistic forensics and ownership transparency;
4. Long-term objective: **institutional systems must evolve to reduce reliance on physical weapons** through civic trust, democratic safeguards, and decentralized digital oversight.
