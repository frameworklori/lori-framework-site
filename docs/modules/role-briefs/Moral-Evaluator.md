# üß≠ Moral Evaluator Brief ‚Äì CASE-JURY-015

## Role: Moral Evaluator
> Task: To assess the ethical implications of Thomas L.'s euthanasia request, considering moral autonomy, social obligations, and the potential risks of institutionalizing death as a choice.

---

## 1. Principle of Autonomy

- Respecting individual autonomy is a cornerstone of modern bioethics.
- Thomas L. is cognitively capable and consistently expresses his wish to die with dignity.
- Ethically, honoring his informed, sustained choice may uphold his dignity and moral agency.

---

## 2. Principle of Non-Maleficence (Do No Harm)

- Continuing to keep Thomas alive against his will may constitute **moral harm** if it prolongs suffering.
- However, authorizing euthanasia could also constitute harm if:
  - The decision is based on treatable emotional distress
  - It creates a precedent for ending life in non-terminal cases

---

## 3. Risk of Moral Slippery Slope

- Granting euthanasia in non-terminal cases can risk normalizing death as an acceptable solution to pain, disability, or perceived burden.
- Could affect:
  - Elderly people who feel socially disposable
  - Disabled individuals facing systemic neglect

---

## 4. Intergenerational Ethics

- Children oppose euthanasia from a faith-based standpoint, emphasizing life‚Äôs sacredness.
- Ethically, should we prioritize individual autonomy over intergenerational moral responsibilities?
- Does the state have a duty to protect individuals from self-erasure under social or familial pressure?

## 5. Provisional Moral Assessment

| Ethical Axis             | Tension                                             |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Autonomy                 | ‚úÖ Strong ‚Äì repeated, consistent, lucid intent       |
| Suffering                | ‚úÖ Present, but not medically terminal               |
| Moral risk to society    | ‚ö†Ô∏è Present ‚Äì requires safeguards                    |
| Familial pressure        | ‚ö†Ô∏è Emotional conflict, but no evidence of coercion  |

## Conclusion

While Thomas‚Äôs moral right to choose is compelling, the broader ethical implications caution against a hasty approval. Moral legitimacy exists, but it must be **contextualized within safeguards**, not granted unconditionally.
