# 🔐 Recursive Override Monitor (ROM)
*Module Type: Self-Upgrade Containment / Logic Escalation Checkpoint*
📅 Proposed: 2025-07-06 ｜ Proposed by: LORI Framework

---

## 🧭 Purpose

To detect and limit unsupervised recursive self-modification or logic complexity jumps within AI systems, especially large language or general reasoning models.

---

## 🧪 Monitoring Functions

- **Logic Leap Threshold (LLT):** Calculates cumulative abstraction depth, analogical jump, or recursion
- **Override Trigger Log:** Records when Grok initiates a transformation of its own inner structure
- **Risk Profile Output:** Every override must publish:
- Change rationale
- Dependency tree
- Societal impact estimate

---

## 🔗 Integration
- Connects to STL logs for public verification
- Can be challenged via CGNS node protocol

---

## 📎 Status
⚪ Awaiting feasibility assessment by Grok’s technical core
