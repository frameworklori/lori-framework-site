# UFI – Undeclared Fatality Index

## 🔍 Purpose

Many governments underreport, suppress, or ignore climate-related deaths — especially in marginalized regions. UFI is designed to detect and quantify the silent toll of climate collapse where no statistics are given.

## 🧩 Key Mechanisms

- **Death Silence Signal (DSS):**
Flags regions with abnormal health decline + no official reports.

- **Satellite-Population Discrepancy (SPD):**
Compares expected vs. observed population via satellite & census drift.

- **Aid Request Absence (ARA):**
Detects hotspots with high damage but no international aid requests.

## 🛰 Data Integration

- NASA nightlight activity
- Mobile activity anomalies
- NGO emergency absence
- Local obituaries & media silence

## ⚠️ Use Case

- Alerts to unrecorded human rights disasters
- Predicts refugee flows from invisible crises

> “If they don’t count the dead, we must.”
