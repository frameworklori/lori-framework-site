# 🕳️ LORI-HFE – Hidden Fact Evaluation Module

**Part of the LORI Framework – Civilization Integrity & Truth Loss Detection Layer**

> This module identifies, interprets, and simulates **evidentiary absences**, media silence, and the erasure of testimonial or institutional signals in high-power, high-risk cases.

---

## 🔍 1. Overview

The **LORI-HFE (Hidden Fact Evaluation)** module is designed to assess situations where **critical facts, witnesses, or processes are conspicuously absent**, and where such absences may indicate intentional concealment, systemic failure, or power-driven suppression.

This module does **not rely on positive evidence**, but instead:
- Flags the **“expected but missing” patterns**;
- Simulates **structural erasure tactics**;
- Provides a framework for scoring **civilizational signal gaps**.

## 🧠 2. Use Cases

| Case Type | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🔫 High-profile unsolved murder | Detects silence clusters, missing timelines, or unexplained witness withdrawal |
| 🛑 Governmental cover-ups | Identifies discrepancies between known events and official records |
| 🎭 Celebrity impunity structures | Detects sudden media reversals, NDA waves, or internal whistleblower disappearance |
| 📉 Institutional decay | Finds signs of collapsed investigative chains or archive manipulation |

## 🧰 3. Core Functions

### HFE-GAP Engine
- Scans historical, legal, media, and testimony records for **expected data gaps** (e.g., "Where is the autopsy?", "Why was surveillance missing?").

### HFE-SCORE Calculator
- Assigns a **Civic Signal Disappearance Score (CSDS)** from 0–100 based on the **intensity and pattern of silence**.

### Erasure Pattern Simulator
- Simulates plausible **silencing architectures**:
- Economic NDAs
- Peer group threats
- Platform memory collapse (SEO delinking, deplatforming)

## ⚠️ 4. Integration with Other Modules

| Linked Module | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| [LORI-AIDM](../modules/AIDM.md) | Detects narrative override and actor substitution |
| [LORI-FEED](../modules/FEED_Module.md) | Flags emotional dampening or artificial harmony injection |
| [LORI-JURY](./modules/LORI-Jury-Based-Judgment.md) | Provides “erasure alert” to AI jury roles for compensatory weighting |
| [LORI-CASE-018](LORI-CASE-018-Diddy-Murder-Simulation.md) | First use case simulating moral guilt but evidentiary collapse |

## 🧯 5. Strategic Insights

LORI-HFE transforms absence into **signal**.
It recognizes that in modern power structures, **what is missing may reveal more than what is present.**

> Civilization decays not only when truth is attacked,
> but when truth becomes unreachable through silence.
