# LORI-ECJ – Environmental Climate Justice Index

## 🌍 Purpose

To quantify and expose climate injustice by mapping which populations suffer the most environmental damage while contributing the least to global emissions. LORI-ECJ aims to reframe the climate crisis as a moral and structural issue, not just a technical or atmospheric one.

## 📊 Index Components

- **Emission-Impact Disparity (EID):**
Measures the gap between a region’s historical emissions and its current climate-related damages.

- **Aid Allocation Bias (AAB):**
Identifies mismatches between received climate aid and actual vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Amplification Score (VAS):**
Assesses how economic poverty, displacement, and healthcare access amplify climate impact.

## 🛰 Data Sources

- IPCC regional emissions
- UNDP climate aid databases
- WHO disaster mortality reports
- Satellite drought/flood mapping overlays

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Directing international aid by justice-weighted priority
- Highlighting geopolitical responsibility
- Supporting climate reparation negotiations
