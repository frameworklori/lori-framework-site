# LORI-RIM – Resilience & Impact Matrix

## 🧭 Purpose

To simulate how long a civilization can maintain continuity under escalating ecological stress, and what interventions can extend its survivability.

## 🧮 Matrix Structure

- **Collapse Curves (CC):**
Predicts societal function degradation across energy, food, water, governance.

- **Shock Absorption Index (SAI):**
Measures capacity to withstand rapid climate events (floods, fires, heatwaves).

- **Intervention Time Gain (ITG):**
Quantifies how much time each strategy buys (e.g., solar transition = +6 yrs).

- **Rescue Signal Delay (RSD):**
Calculates window for external or AGI-level interventions before system failure.

## 🧪 Simulation Inputs

- IPCC climate projection layers
- Infrastructure decay models
- Migration thresholds
- AI-system dependencies

> “Collapse is not a moment — it's a slope. RIM tells us how steep it is and how long we can hold on.”
