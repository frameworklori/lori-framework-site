## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ownership Structure

Upon creation, **academic outputs** (including but not limited to: research papers, preprints, experimental data, internal reports) shall be jointly owned as follows:

- **National/Public Interest:** 1/3
- **Academic Institution/Community:** 1/3
- **Individual Author(s):** 1/3

This ownership structure ensures alignment between national interests, institutional stewardship, and individual intellectual contribution.
