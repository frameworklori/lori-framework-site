# Prompt Semantic Shift Tracking

## Module Purpose
Detect changes in prompt structure, interpretation, and semantic framing between models trained in free and censored societies.

## Objectives
- Track loss or distortion of meaning when prompts are translated or restructured across languages and models.
- Detect embedded censorship behaviors (e.g., avoidance of political terms, euphemism inflation).
- Assess semantic drift between open-source models and downstream usage in controlled regimes.

## Core Tools
- Comparative prompt decoding logs
- Linguistic heatmaps of sensitive terms
- Semantic integrity index (SII)
