## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Purpose

The **ODRAF-MRC (Mobility Risk Closure)** Module is designed to evaluate and enhance governance maturity regarding the risks associated with:

- Cross-border mobility of **knowledge assets**
- Dynamic transmission of **academic, technological, and intellectual property data**
- Integrity of national **Knowledge Sovereignty** enforcement mechanisms

This module was introduced following deliberations in **LORI-CASE-008**, where gaps in current cross-domain boundary governance were identified.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Knowledge Sovereignty Closure Maturity Assessment

| Dimension | Maturity Level | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Ownership Legalization (1/3 model) | Low | No formal law yet established (Bayh-Dole Act limits current scope) |
| Cross-border Transmission Governance | Low | No systematic enforcement; relies on export control loopholes (ITAR/EAR) |
| AI-assisted Monitoring | Fragmented | Limited to certain sensitive fields; lacks academic domain standardization |
| Public/Authorized Sharing Clarity | Low-Medium | Some standards exist (publications), but pre-publication definitions unclear |
| International Enforcement Readiness | Very Low | No bilateral/multilateral governance closure with Canada/Mexico/others |
| Institutional Compliance Ecosystem | Low | Varies by institution; no national academic knowledge governance framework yet |

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Governance Recommendations

- **Integrate Knowledge Sovereignty Layer** systematically into **dynamic boundary governance** workflows.
- Expand AI-assisted monitoring to cover **academic and research data flows**.
- Prioritize **legal foundation** for shared ownership and cross-border transmission controls.
- Develop **international governance dialogues** to close cross-border enforcement gaps.
