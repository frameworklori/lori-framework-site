## A14 – Visual Capture + Regenerative AI Fraud

**Category**: Intellectual Property Theft × AI-Based Regeneration Fraud
**Risk Level**: 🔴 High (IP breach + model imitation + attribution ambiguity)

---

### 📌 Fraud Process Description:

1. The perpetrator captures original proprietary materials (e.g., diagrams, architecture files, documentation) through unauthorized photography, screenshots, or screen recording.
2. The captured images are processed by Vision-AI + LLMs to extract structure, content, and semantics.
3. The AI system regenerates modified versions that imitate the original content under a different form or style.
4. The regenerated content is repackaged and published, often with attribution removed or disguised, leading to misappropriated originality.

### ⚠️ Key Detection Signals:

| Dimension | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Capture Method | Smartphone photo, screen grab, hidden recording |
| Regeneration Style| Reconstructed using vision-to-text + generative LLM |
| Deception Tactic | Semantic rewriting, structural mimicry, reworded expressions |
| Detection Difficulty | High – requires content fingerprinting and trace back mechanisms |

### 🧩 Linked Detection Modules:

- `Trace Report v1.0` – Logs timestamp, device fingerprint, behavioral signature
- `SAID` (Self-Activated Intervention Detector) – Flags unsolicited perception/activation
- `DRM` (Distillation Reverse Engineering Monitor) – Tracks semantic regeneration
- `IPBCL` (IP Breach Classification Layer) – Assigns fraud taxonomy and breach codes

### 📎 Representative Case:

**Case A14-001**: On 2025-06-09, unauthorized smartphone capture of the LORI Framework’s public governance diagram was followed by suspected AI-driven content regeneration.
Trace Report v1.0 triggered, and the incident was officially embedded into LORI's sovereignty defense layer as a critical model exploitation case.
