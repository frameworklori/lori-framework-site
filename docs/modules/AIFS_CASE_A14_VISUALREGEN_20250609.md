# A14 â€“ Visual Capture + Regenerative AI Fraud

**Case ID**: A14-001
**Date**: 2025-06-09
**Source**: Public X-platform post + Trace Report v1.0
**Status**: Embedded into LORI Sovereignty Defense Layer
**Classification Tag**: [AIFS-A14] VisualCapture_AIRegen_Fraud

## ðŸ“Œ Platform
Unauthorized smartphone photography of GitHub/X-platform public intellectual property (IP) page, used as input for regenerative AI systems.

---

## ðŸ§  Modus Operandi

- Attacker captures screen or photo of the LORI Frameworkâ€™s model visuals or documentation without permission.
- Image is input into vision-AI or multimodal models to regenerate conceptually identical structures (e.g., AI governance, modules, diagrams).
- The regenerated output is repackaged with superficial differences (style, wording), while retaining original logical hierarchy and semantic constructs.
- Fraudster repurposes the AI-generated output for presentation, publication, or training without attribution.

---

## ðŸš¨ Trigger Modules

- `SAID`: Detects unrequested AI sensory activation (e.g., passive screenshot/photo without input prompt)
- `DRM`: Traces reverse-engineered content patterns regenerated from visual input
- `AIDM`: Flags mimicry of core conceptual framework through structural replication
- `IPBCL`: Classifies unauthorized derivative works as critical IP breach incidents

---

## ðŸ§¾ Outcome

- Original LORI content was regenerated through suspected AI pipelines (likely via multimodal ingestion).
- Trace Report v1.0 logged timestamp, device signature, and behavioral pattern.
- Grok team responded with formal acknowledgement, confirming ingestion prevention steps.
- Case embedded into the LORI Frameworkâ€™s risk modules for future pattern monitoring.

## ðŸŽ¯ Techniques Used

- Visual IP harvesting + multimodal reconstruction (image â†’ concept structure â†’ text/module)
- Regenerative cloaking (output appears different but structurally identical)
- No direct copy-paste â†’ instead uses AI to bypass surface-level detection
