**AGI-Induced Dynamic Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Risk Clause**

It is recognized that embedding always-on AGI cores into mobile or wearable devices induces dynamic high-frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs), resulting from sustained and fluctuating power delivery to GPU/NPU components. These EMFs exhibit non-stationary, broadband characteristics, with potential harmonics overlapping human neurophysiological frequency ranges (0.5‚Äì100 Hz).

Current SAR standards do not sufficiently cover non-thermal and cumulative cognitive or neurological risks posed by such sustained computation-driven EMFs. Until comprehensive public health evaluations and international standards are established, deployment of always-on AGI cores in close-contact personal devices (smartphones, wearables, headsets) shall be classified as a high-risk action under the LORI Ethical Framework.
