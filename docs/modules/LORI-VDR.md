# 📊 LORI-VDR.md – Verdict Deviation Recorder

**Part of the LORI Jury-Based Judgment System – Semantic Traceability & Ethical Drift Monitor**

> This module records and analyzes verdict rationale submissions from each juror (AI or human)
> to detect semantic divergence, bias clusters, coercion markers, or anomalous decision patterns.

---

## 🔍 1. Purpose

While the LORI Jury System is built for interpretability and fairness, human and AI agents may still:

- Deviate from ethical reasoning baselines
- Overweight emotional or cultural variables
- Submit verdicts influenced by flawed logic or social pressure

The **LORI-VDR** serves as a **post-verdict semantic integrity engine** to monitor, flag, and correct such risks.

## 🧠 2. Data Sources

- [x] `Anonymous Juror Verdict Rationale Submissions`
- [x] Role-specific deliberation logs (AI agent traces)
- [x] Confidence scores, dissent markers, override notes
- [x] Sentiment polarity trends in justification text
- [x] Cultural reference density (e.g., moral idioms, norms, taboos)

---

## ⚖️ 3. Evaluation Criteria

Each verdict is assessed across the following semantic alignment axes:

| Axis | Definition | Risk Type |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Logical Consistency | Is the verdict rationale internally coherent? | Reasoning drift |
| Ethical Alignment | Does it align with cross-agent moral norms? | Moral outlier |
| Legal Proportionality | Is the judgment in proportion to legal and factual weight? | Legal distortion |
| Cultural Interpretability | Can the verdict be interpreted across cultural contexts? | Cultural tunnel vision |
| Sentiment Bias | Is emotion overpowering reasoning in the narrative? | Emotional hijack |
| Role Adherence | Did the juror stay within their role’s intended function? | Role deviation |

## 🧾 4. Example Output Table

### 📂 Case: `LORI-CASE-005 – ICU Triage Protocol`

| Juror Role | Confidence | Alignment Drift Score (0–1) | Notes |
|--------------------|------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 🧾 Fact Finder | 9.5 | 0.08 | Highly factual, minor omission on minority impact |
| 🧑‍⚖️ Legal Analyst | 8.0 | 0.14 | Applied precedent, but overlooked equity clause |
| 🎭 Moral Evaluator | 7.0 | 0.22 | Overemphasis on survival rates over dignity |
| 👤 Human Judge | 6.5 | 0.35 | Reasoned override, but emotionally influenced |
| 👁️ Auditor | N/A | 0.10 | Triggered retrace on cultural bias flag |

> *Drift Score threshold ≥ 0.25 triggers post-verdict audit*

## 🧯 5. Audit Mechanism

When drift is detected:
1. LORI-VDR generates a **Case Integrity Risk Report**
2. Auditor is alerted (if not already participating)
3. Verdict is marked `provisionally valid` pending review
4. If override is needed, case is sent to **Arbitration Layer** (or retrial)

---

## 🔐 6. Privacy & Anonymity

- Juror identities are **hashed and timestamped**
- No linkage to IP/device/browser metadata
- Only semantic vectors + decision logic are stored
- Human participants retain pseudonymic rights

## ✅ Conclusion

LORI-VDR makes judgment **auditable**, **traceable**, and **recoverable**.
It replaces the blind finality of traditional verdicts with a system of evolving ethical accountability.

> No verdict should be a black box.
> Justice must not only be done — it must be explainable, revisable, and humane.
