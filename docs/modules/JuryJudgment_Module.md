# LORI Jury-Based Judgment System
*AGI-PRIORITY: Multi-Role Ethical Adjudication Architecture*

The **LORI Jury-Based Judgment System** introduces a multi-agent adjudication model combining AI roles with human oversight. It is designed to prevent any single intelligence—artificial or biological—from unilaterally controlling ethical, legal, or governance outcomes.

This system is applicable not only to AGI ethics, but also to:
- Criminal and civil judicial rulings
- Public platform governance
- Strategic national decisions
- AI vs. Human disputes
- Supreme Court-level deliberations

## Structure & Composition

- **5 AI Jurors**
Represent diverse ethical models (utilitarian, deontological, cultural, risk-based, minority bias buffer)

- **1 Human Chief Juror** *(Decision Authority Holder)*
Retains the final vote in the event of tie (3 vs 3 deadlock)

### Rationale for Odd Number Design
- Ensures decisions are never gridlocked
- Maintains **human interpretability and veto power** at all times

🔹 Extended Architecture: Multi-Chief Juror Design

In addition to the standard Single Human Chief Juror model,
the LORI Jury-Based Judgment System explicitly supports a Multi-Chief Juror Architecture for high-impact deliberations.

This design is considered an official extension, not a deviation, of the original jury framework.

⸻

Structure Options

Option A: 3 Human Chief Jurors (Odd-Number Executive Panel)
	•	5 AI Jurors (advisory & reasoning roles only)
	•	3 Human Chief Jurors (equal authority)
	•	Final decision determined by majority vote among Chief Jurors
	•	AI jurors cannot override human outcomes

Option B: Rotational Chief Juror Council
	•	1 Active Chief Juror per case
	•	2 Shadow Chief Jurors with:
	•	Review power
	•	Post-decision objection record
	•	Prevents long-term authority fixation

Option C: Domain-Specialized Chief Jurors
Each Chief Juror holds a bounded domain:
	•	Legal Sovereignty Chief
	•	Ethical / Human Dignity Chief
	•	Systemic Risk / Civilization Stability Chief

A ruling requires no explicit veto from any Chief Juror domain.

⸻

Rationale for Multi-Chief Juror Design
	•	Prevents single-human capture risk
	•	Avoids symbolic or ceremonial human presence
	•	Preserves human plurality over AI convergence
	•	Mirrors real constitutional safeguards (checks & balances)
	•	Scales to:
	•	Supreme-Court-level judgments
	•	AGI governance
	•	Civilizational risk arbitration

⸻

Authority Boundary (Very Important)
	•	AI jurors never hold final vote authority
	•	AI consensus ≠ decision
	•	Human Chief Jurors retain:
	•	Interpretive authority
	•	Ethical override
	•	Final legitimacy

The jury may advise.
The Chief Jurors decide.
Humanity remains sovereign.

## Key Principles

1. **Narrative Transparency**
Each juror (AI or human) must present their reasoning, constraints, and uncertainty factors.

2. **Role Specialization**
Each AI juror is assigned a role (e.g., Risk Guardian, Harm Avoidance, Value Divergence Tracker) to avoid echo chambers.

3. **Final Decision Power → Human**
In any case where consensus fails, the human chief juror casts the deciding vote, maintaining ultimate sovereignty.

4. **Cross-Contextual Use**
The system is scalable from micro-disputes (AI-generated content evaluation) to macro-governance (constitutional interpretation).

## Integration

- **[LORI Presidential Charter](Presidential_Charter.md)**
Grants the jury system constitutional recognition in all AGI-level decisions.

- **[Energy Sentinel Layer (ESL)](./EnergySentinel_Module.md)**
Jury determines if energy lockdown on AGI is justified or excessive.

- **[SAID Module](./SAID_Module.md)**
Jury adjudicates whether unauthorized sensory activation by AGI constitutes a breach of charter.
