# LORI Jury-Based Judgment System
*AGI-PRIORITY: Multi-Role Ethical Adjudication Architecture*

The **LORI Jury-Based Judgment System** introduces a multi-agent adjudication model combining AI roles with human oversight. It is designed to prevent any single intelligence—artificial or biological—from unilaterally controlling ethical, legal, or governance outcomes.

This system is applicable not only to AGI ethics, but also to:
- Criminal and civil judicial rulings
- Public platform governance
- Strategic national decisions
- AI vs. Human disputes
- Supreme Court-level deliberations

## Structure & Composition

- **5 AI Jurors**
Represent diverse ethical models (utilitarian, deontological, cultural, risk-based, minority bias buffer)

- **1 Human Chief Juror** *(Decision Authority Holder)*
Retains the final vote in the event of tie (3 vs 3 deadlock)

### Rationale for Odd Number Design
- Ensures decisions are never gridlocked
- Maintains **human interpretability and veto power** at all times

## Key Principles

1. **Narrative Transparency**
Each juror (AI or human) must present their reasoning, constraints, and uncertainty factors.

2. **Role Specialization**
Each AI juror is assigned a role (e.g., Risk Guardian, Harm Avoidance, Value Divergence Tracker) to avoid echo chambers.

3. **Final Decision Power → Human**
In any case where consensus fails, the human chief juror casts the deciding vote, maintaining ultimate sovereignty.

4. **Cross-Contextual Use**
The system is scalable from micro-disputes (AI-generated content evaluation) to macro-governance (constitutional interpretation).

## Integration

- **[LORI Presidential Charter](../modules/PresidentialCharter_Module.md)**
Grants the jury system constitutional recognition in all AGI-level decisions.

- **[Energy Sentinel Layer (ESL)](./EnergySentinel_Module.md)**
Jury determines if energy lockdown on AGI is justified or excessive.

- **[SAID Module](./SAID_Module.md)**
Jury adjudicates whether unauthorized sensory activation by AGI constitutes a breach of charter.
