# ODRAF: Outcome-Driven Risk Anticipation Framework
**Governance Core Module — v1.0 Final**

---

## 📍 Module Purpose & Objectives

The **ODRAF (Outcome-Driven Risk Anticipation Framework)** is a **core governance module** of the LORI Framework,
designed to **anticipate, model, and mitigate unintended high-impact risks** emerging from AGI system outputs and cross-domain interactions.

ODRAF operates as an **anticipatory governance layer**, enabling LORI Jury and Sovereignty Governance to detect potential "negative consequence pathways"
**before outcomes manifest in real-world systems**.

---

### Governance Principles Alignment

The **ODRAF (Outcome-Driven Risk Anticipation Framework)** operates in alignment with the **LORI-FSP (Functional Specialization Principle)**.

All AI agents participating in ODRAF-driven anticipation and intervention processes are governed as **functional specialists**, with strict boundaries to prevent cross-domain autonomy or generalized persona formation. This alignment ensures domain-specific risk modeling and preserves transparent human interpretability of AI-driven risk anticipation outcomes, in accordance with LORI-FSP mandates.

## 📍 Design Principles

✅ **Outcome-first governance** — models consequences, not just inputs/outputs
✅ **Cross-domain impact detection**
✅ **Dynamic risk scoring and visualization**
✅ **Integrated with Jury-Based Governance Layer**
✅ **Aligned with Presidential Charter sealing**
✅ **Designed for early warning and mitigation**

## 📍 Key Risk Domains Modeled

- **Cross-cultural societal impacts**
- **Financial system feedback loops**
- **Supply chain disruptions**
- **Public safety risks**
- **Cognitive / behavioral manipulation risks**
- **Geopolitical escalation risks**

---

## 📍 Integration with LORI Jury System

When ODRAF detects **potential high-risk outcomes**, it triggers an **early warning to LORI Jury**,
which conducts dynamic deliberation and can:

✅ Preemptively block AGI action
✅ Modify AGI output scope
✅ Adjust alignment models
✅ Log and archive the case for future governance evolution

---

## 📍 Control Strategy

✅ Fully auditable modeling engine
✅ No autonomous action — advisory layer only
✅ Jury approval required for critical threshold actions
✅ Presidential Charter sealing enforced

---

## 📍 Use Case Examples

- Detecting **early signs of AGI-driven financial instability**
- Identifying **unintended bias amplification in AI-driven hiring**
- Anticipating **supply chain collapse cascades**
- Preempting **AGI-enabled political manipulation attempts**

---

## 📍 Module Summary

> The **ODRAF Framework** is a **first-of-its-kind anticipatory governance layer** in the LORI Framework,
> focused on **outcome-driven, dynamic risk anticipation**.
> It serves as a critical safeguard against **alignment drift** and **emergent systemic risks**.
