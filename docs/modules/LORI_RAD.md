## 🧭 Module Overview

**LORI-RAD** establishes a structured responsibility allocation model for harm caused by AI-generated deepfakes, synthetic media, and AI-assisted fraud. As generative tools become widely accessible and malicious usage increases, this module aims to guide how accountability should be distributed among different actors—**developers, platforms, deployers, and users**—in accordance with **ethical risk, proximity to intent, and control over distribution**.

The goal is not to punish innovation, but to **safeguard civil integrity** while enabling technology to thrive under shared ethical commitments.

## 🔍 Core Framework: Responsibility Chain

LORI-RAD introduces a 3-tier model:

| Tier | Actor Type | Responsibility Domain | Example Roles |
|------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| R1 | **Originator** | AI model creators, architecture designers | Foundation model labs, open-source coders |
| R2 | **Enabler/Distributor** | Platforms, hosting services, deployment APIs | Social media, cloud services, chatbot interfaces |
| R3 | **Executor/User** | End-users creating or distributing harmful content | Deepfake blackmailers, impersonation scammers |

---

## ⚖️ Allocation Principles

1. **Intent Proximity Principle**
The closer an actor is to the malicious intent, the higher their accountability.

2. **Control Capacity Principle**
Those who **can prevent**, **filter**, or **intervene** but fail to do so bear **increased burden**.

3. **Profit Participation Principle**
Entities monetizing or profiting from risky behaviors without mitigation strategies assume **residual responsibility**.

4. **Systemic Risk Amplification**
If an actor’s role significantly increases the **scale or speed** of harm, their share of accountability grows—even if they are not the originator.

## 🧩 Integration with LORI Systems

| Integrated Module | Function |
|-----------------------|----------|
| **LORI-JURY** | Enables ethical deliberation of actor-level culpability in real-time deepfake scenarios |
| **ODRAF** | Simulates downstream impacts to determine accountability gradients |
| **EDRI-H** | Measures emotional harm and manipulation severity |
| **LORI-FIT** | Detects semantic infiltration and weaponized AI dialogue preconditions |

## 📎 Use Cases

### 🧪 Case 014: Trust Disqualification of AI Leaders
Used to examine ethical breakdown in leadership responsibility regarding unchecked AI misuse, platform silence, or complicit architecture design.

### 📹 Deepfake Threat Campaigns
Application of LORI-RAD to allocate fault between model developers (e.g., no watermarking), social media platforms (viral spread), and malicious creators.

## 🛑 Cautionary Clause

> “AI without responsibility is not intelligence—it is unleashed capacity without conscience.”
> — LORI System Ethics Advisory, 2025

LORI-RAD rejects any blanket exoneration such as:
- "The model is neutral"
- "We just provide the tools"
- "It’s up to the users"

Ethical design means shared consequence.

---

## 📘 Policy Recommendations

- Require **shared liability clauses** in platform terms for deepfake amplification
- Develop **traceable watermarking standards** for generative models
- Integrate **automated flagging + human escalation layers** in AI deployment platforms
- Empower legal frameworks to apply **flexible responsibility gradients** rather than binary guilt
