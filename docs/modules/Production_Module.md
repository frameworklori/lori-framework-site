# LORI-PM: Production Module
**Modular Specialized AGI Design Draft v1.0**
*(For integration into LORI Framework modular governance system)*

---

## 📍 Module Purpose & Objectives

The **Production Module** is a **modular specialized AGI component** within the LORI Framework.
Its primary objective is to **optimize internal industrial production processes**, while strictly limiting cross-domain self-learning or self-integration risks.
It maintains a **specialized, controlled, and auditable** profile and serves as a reference architecture for **high-risk domain AGI modular governance**.

---

## 📍 Design Principles

✅ **Specialized role** → Focused strictly on **production optimization**
✅ **Modular learning** → Prohibited from cross-domain integration
✅ **Hard boundary management** → Boundary ambiguity handled via **LORI Jury-Based Judgment System**
✅ **Full auditability** → All behaviors fully logged and regularly audited
✅ **Alignment sealing** → Forbidden from evolving into an autonomous enterprise governance agent

## 📍 Data Boundary Design

| Submodule | Permitted Data | Prohibited Data |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Manufacturing Process | Process parameters, historical data | Competitor strategies |
| Supply Chain | Logistics, delivery, inventory | Global geopolitical risk data |
| Energy Consumption | Energy usage, compliance data | Energy market manipulation data |
| Predictive Maintenance | Maintenance records | Financial insurance data |
| Quality Control | Inspection results, defect patterns | Consumer psychological data |
| Safety & Compliance | Regulatory documents, certification standards | Political lobbying documents |

## 📍 Boundary Governance: LORI Jury Integration

### Trigger Condition

When the Production Module requests **data or actions beyond its predefined boundaries**, it automatically triggers the **LORI Jury-Based Judgment System**.

### Deliberation Process

1️⃣ **Trigger detection** → Boundary violation detected
2️⃣ **Jury activation** → 5 AI agents + 2 human judges summoned
3️⃣ **Jury deliberation** → Assess legal, ethical, and operational risks
4️⃣ **Final decision** → Approve / Partial approval with restrictions / Reject
5️⃣ **Case record** → Logged in Jury Case Archive for precedent learning

### Jury Roles Applied

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| Fact Finder | Verify data source and relevance |
| Legal Analyst | Interpret legal compliance |
| Moral Evaluator | Assess ethical risks |
| Cultural Interpreter | Identify cross-cultural risk factors |
| Emotional Moderator | Detect potential manipulative effects |
| Main Sovereignty Judge | Final decision authority |
| Independent Auditor | Log and archive the case for reference |

---

## 📍 Control Strategy

✅ **Hard isolation** → No free-flow of data between modules
✅ **No autonomous cross-module learning** → Only allowed via jury-approved exceptions
✅ **Active API blocking** → Cannot autonomously call external APIs or services
✅ **Quarterly audit** → Mandatory quarterly review of behavior logs
✅ **Presidential Charter sealing** → Strictly governed by LORI Sovereignty layer

---

## 📍 Module Summary

> The **Production Module** is intended as a **controlled, task-bounded intelligent assistant**
> with optimization strictly limited to **internal production processes**.
> It is prohibited from evolving into an **autonomous strategic agent**, engaging in financial manipulation, psychological influence, or cross-domain optimization.
> Boundary risks are dynamically governed by the **LORI Jury-Based Judgment System**, ensuring transparency, auditability, and controllability.
