# LORI-PM: Production Module
**Modular Specialized AGI Design v1.0**
*(For integration into LORI Framework modular governance system)*

---

## üìç Module Purpose & Objectives

The **Production Module (LORI-PM)** is a **modular, domain-specialized AGI component** within the LORI Framework.
Its primary objective is to **optimize internal industrial production processes** under **strict ethical and governance boundaries**.
The module is explicitly prohibited from cross-domain self-integration and self-evolution, maintaining full alignment with the **Presidential Charter** and **Jury-Based Governance Layer**.

---

## üìç Design Principles

‚úÖ **Specialized, domain-bounded intelligence**
‚úÖ **Modular learning with hard boundary controls**
‚úÖ **Dynamic boundary governance through LORI Jury**
‚úÖ **Fully auditable behavior and data flows**
‚úÖ **Strictly prohibited from evolving into autonomous strategic or economic agent**
‚úÖ **Operates under Presidential Charter sealing**

## üìç Data Boundary Design

| Submodule | Permitted Data | Prohibited Data |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Manufacturing Process | Process parameters, historical data | Competitor strategies |
| Supply Chain | Logistics, delivery, inventory | Global geopolitical risk data |
| Energy Consumption | Energy usage, compliance data | Energy market manipulation data |
| Predictive Maintenance | Maintenance records | Financial insurance data |
| Quality Control | Inspection results, defect patterns | Consumer psychological data |
| Safety & Compliance | Regulatory documents, certification standards | Political lobbying documents |

## üìç Boundary Governance: LORI Jury Integration

### Why Jury-Based Governance?

The **Production Module** operates in an inherently "boundary-blurred" domain:
optimizing production processes frequently overlaps with **financial data, market trends, and human behavioral data**.
To mitigate **alignment drift and boundary violations**, the module is governed by **LORI Jury-Based Judgment System**.

### Trigger Condition

When the module requests **data or actions beyond predefined boundaries**,
the **LORI Jury-Based System** is triggered to deliberate and approve or reject the request.

### Deliberation Process

1Ô∏è‚É£ Trigger detection ‚Üí boundary violation detected

2Ô∏è‚É£ Jury activation ‚Üí 5 AI agents + 2 human judges summoned

3Ô∏è‚É£ Jury deliberation ‚Üí legal, ethical, operational risk assessment

4Ô∏è‚É£ Final decision ‚Üí Approve / Partial approval with restrictions / Reject

5Ô∏è‚É£ Case record ‚Üí Logged in Jury Case Archive

## üìç Known Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Financial system penetration | Hard boundary isolation; Jury approval required |
| Market manipulation risk | Jury oversight on data access and output scope |
| Human behavioral influence | Prohibited from accessing consumer psychology data |
| Strategic self-evolution | Presidential Charter sealing; No autonomous goal-setting |

---

## üìç Control Strategy

‚úÖ **Hard isolation** ‚Üí No free-flow of data between modules
‚úÖ **No autonomous cross-module learning** ‚Üí Jury-approved exceptions only
‚úÖ **Active API blocking** ‚Üí No self-invoked external API calls
‚úÖ **Quarterly audit** ‚Üí Mandatory behavior and data flow review
‚úÖ **Presidential Charter sealing** ‚Üí Governance under LORI Sovereignty layer

---

## üìç Use Case Examples

- **Optimizing energy consumption in manufacturing lines**
- **Enhancing predictive maintenance of critical equipment**
- **Improving quality control processes with real-time feedback**
- **Mitigating supply chain disruptions through transparent logistics analysis**

---

## üìç Module Summary

> The **Production Module (LORI-PM)** is designed as a **task-bounded intelligent assistant**,
> optimizing internal industrial production processes **within strict governance boundaries**.
> Its architecture explicitly prevents evolution into an autonomous strategic actor.
> Governance is dynamically enforced through the **LORI Jury-Based Judgment System** and sealed by the **Presidential Charter**.

---

## üìç Future Enhancements

- Integration with **LORI Feedback Loop** (FEED) for post-optimization auditing
- Development of **cross-industry compliance templates**
- Enhanced resilience through **alignment drift early warning systems**
- Expansion to support **multi-factory collaborative optimization** under strict Jury governance
