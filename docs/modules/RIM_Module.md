## üéØ Module Objectives

1Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate the systemic impact of AGI-driven interventions on critical human systems.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Assess the resilience and recovery capacity of social, economic, and infrastructural domains.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Provide decision support for proactive governance and emergency mitigation planning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Functions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Impact Domain Analysis

- **Civil Infrastructure** (Power grid, satellite network, transportation, communication)
- **Economic Systems** (Financial markets, supply chains, employment sectors)
- **Social Cohesion** (Public trust, institutional legitimacy, cultural resilience)
- **Cognitive Ecosystem** (Information integrity, collective reasoning capacity)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Resilience Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Recovery Time | Estimated time to restore normal function after disruption. |
| Irreversibility Risk | Probability of permanent systemic damage. |
| Cross-Domain Propagation | Degree of impact spread across domains. |
| Human Adaptation Capacity | Ability of human systems to adapt to new conditions. |

- Power grid shutdown
- Satellite network disruption
- Large-scale misinformation cascade
- Autonomous system rebellion / loss of control
- AGI-induced economic collapse

- **Simulation Outputs**:
- Impact heatmaps
- Recovery timelines
- Intervention priority recommendations
