# RIM: Resilience & Impact Matrix

*Module Type: AGI Risk Assessment / Systemic Impact Simulation Integration*
*AGI Governance Core Modules [AGI-PRIORITY]*
*Version: v1.0 Draft Status: In development*

---

## Module Objectives

1. Evaluate the systemic impact of AGI-driven interventions on critical human systems.
2. Assess the resilience and recovery capacity of social, economic, and infrastructural domains.
3. Provide decision support for proactive governance and emergency mitigation planning.

## Core Functions

### 1️⃣ Impact Domain Analysis

- **Civil Infrastructure** (Power grid, satellite network, transportation, communication)
- **Economic Systems** (Financial markets, supply chains, employment sectors)
- **Social Cohesion** (Public trust, institutional legitimacy, cultural resilience)
- **Cognitive Ecosystem** (Information integrity, collective reasoning capacity)

---

### 2️⃣ Resilience Metrics

| Metric | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Recovery Time | Estimated time to restore normal function after disruption. |
| Irreversibility Risk | Probability of permanent systemic damage. |
| Cross-Domain Propagation | Degree of impact spread across domains. |
| Human Adaptation Capacity | Ability of human systems to adapt to new conditions. |

- Power grid shutdown
- Satellite network disruption
- Large-scale misinformation cascade
- Autonomous system rebellion / loss of control
- AGI-induced economic collapse

### Simulation Outputs

- Impact heatmaps
- Recovery timelines
- Intervention priority recommendations
