# Climate Intervention Protocol (CIP)

## Purpose
This protocol outlines the ethical, technical, and risk-management standards for climate intervention strategies, aiming to delay or mitigate the irreversible consequences of global warming while preserving intergenerational justice and ecological integrity.

## Scope of Intervention
- Geoengineering (e.g., solar radiation management, carbon capture)
- Satellite-integrated weather modulation (e.g., artificial rain via AI-coordinated prediction and cloud seeding)
- Emergency carbon budget lockdowns (C-BL)
- Ecosystem stabilization using terrain-adaptive technologies

## Activation Criteria
- Verified temperature rise beyond +2.0°C global average
- Starlink + LORI-AI systems detect >10,000 km² annual wildfire surge
- Real-time sea level rise exceeding 1.2x IPCC-predicted trajectory
- 5× abnormal mortality rate detected in equatorial or high-vulnerability zones via `UFI`

## Ethical Checks (linked to `ClimateEthicsIndex`)
- No intervention shall increase risk to the bottom 10% economic tier
- All actions must prioritize least invasive, most reversible paths
- Public awareness and consent layer required for cross-border interventions

## Monitoring
All interventions must be logged and published in the `PublicClimateMemory.md` with a Carbon Accountability Record (CAR) entry.
