## Description
Records oil shale water demand and its competition with firefighting water from 2021-2025, linked to W3, indirectly affecting wildfire control.

## Data Table

| Year | Fire_Name | Location | Oil_Shale_Water_Demand_(barrels_water/barrel_oil) | Firefighting_Water_Competition | Source | Notes |
|------|------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| 2021 | Dixie Fire | Plumas/Butte | 0.1-0.5 | Yes (competes with firefighting water, potential reduction in supply) | CalFire/DWR | Monterey Shale; limited commercial extraction |
| 2025 | Madre Fire | San Luis Obispo | 0.1-0.5 | Yes (competes with firefighting water, potential reduction in supply) | CalFire/DWR | Monterey Shale; limited commercial extraction |
| 2025 | Palisades Fire | Los Angeles | 0.1-0.5 | Yes (competes with firefighting water, 10% hydrants dry due to pressure issues) | CalFire/DWR | Monterey Shale; water pressure issues noted |
| 2025 | Tule River Fire | Tule River Reservation | N/A | No | Tule River Tribe | Non-oil shale region; no extraction activity |
| 2025 | Addie Fire | Kern County | 0.1-0.5 | Yes (competes with firefighting water, potential reduction in supply) | CalFire | Monterey Shale; estimated data |
| 2025 | Alpaugh Fire | Tulare County | N/A | No | CalFire | Non-oil shale region; no extraction activity |

## Analysis
- **Oil Shale Impact**: Monterey Shale (0.1-0.5 barrels/barrel oil) competes with firefighting water, worsening pressure issues (W3: Palisades, 10% dry hydrants, July 17 note).
- **Fire Impact**: Competition increases burned area in Monterey Shale regions (W3: Palisades, 38,690 acres vs. Tule River, 15,000 acres, no competition).
- **Module Link**: Oil shale reduces firefighting water, reinforcing “water as the cause”; extinguishing agents (W4) supplement shortages.
