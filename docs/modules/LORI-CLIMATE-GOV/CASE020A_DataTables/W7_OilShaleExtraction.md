# W7_OilShaleExtraction

## Description
Records oil shale water demand and competition with firefighting water from 2021-2025, analyzing CASE-020A’s safety vs. economy and industry vs. ecology tensions, with LORI-CASE-020’s agriculture prioritization guiding allocation ethics.

## Data Table

| Year | Fire_Name | Location | Oil_Shale_Water_Demand_(barrels_water/barrel_oil) | Firefighting_Water_Competition | Source | Notes |
|------|------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| 2021 | Dixie Fire | Plumas/Butte | 0.1-0.5 | Yes (competes with firefighting water, potential reduction in supply) | CalFire/DWR | Monterey Shale; limited commercial extraction |
| 2025 | Madre Fire | San Luis Obispo | 0.1-0.5 | Yes (competes with firefighting water, potential reduction in supply) | CalFire/DWR | Monterey Shale; limited commercial extraction |
| 2025 | Palisades Fire | Los Angeles | 0.1-0.5 | Yes (competes with firefighting water, 10% hydrants dry due to pressure issues) | CalFire/DWR | Monterey Shale; water pressure issues noted |
| 2025 | Tule River Fire | Tule River Reservation | N/A | No | Tule River Tribe | Non-oil shale region; no extraction activity |
| 2025 | Addie Fire | Kern County | 0.1-0.5 | Yes (competes with firefighting water, potential reduction in supply) | CalFire | Monterey Shale; estimated data |
| 2025 | Alpaugh Fire | Tulare County | N/A | No | CalFire | Non-oil shale region; no extraction activity |

## Analysis
- **Oil Shale Impact**: Monterey Shale’s water demand (0.1-0.5 barrels/barrel oil) competes with firefighting (W3: Palisades, 10% hydrants dry, [web:9]), increasing burned area (38,690 acres vs. Tule River’s 15,000 acres, no competition), aligning with CASE-020A’s safety vs. economy and industry vs. ecology tensions.
- **Agriculture Priority**: LORI-CASE-020’s agriculture prioritization suggests limiting oil shale water drawdown during fire season (CASE-020A simulation thread), prioritizing public safety.
- **Simulation Thread**: CASE-020A’s proposed fire-season extraction limits and AI-based water optimization could reduce competition, enhancing firefighting capacity.
- **Module Link**: Oil shale reduces firefighting water, reinforcing “water as the cause”; technology (W4, Phos-Chek, [web:6]) supplements shortages but increases costs.
- **Data Advisory**: 2025 data are projections; Monterey Shale extraction is limited. Delay release until CARB’s SB 253 regulations (July 1, 2025,) clarify water use reporting.[](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/02/californias-climate-disclosure-laws-navigating-the-latest-updates)
