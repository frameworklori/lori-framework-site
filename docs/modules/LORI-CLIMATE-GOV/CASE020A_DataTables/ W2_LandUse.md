# W2_LandUse.md

## Description
Records land use types (e.g., agriculture, oil shale) in wildfire areas, analyzing their impact on water allocation, linked to W3 (water resources) and W7 (oil shale).

## Data Table

| Year | Fire Name | Location | Land Use Type | Water Allocation Priority | Source | Notes |
|------|------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1910 | Great Fire | Idaho/Montana/Washington | Forest | None | USFS Historical Records | No modern water allocation |
| 2021 | Dixie Fire | Plumas/Butte | Forest/Agriculture | Agriculture > Firefighting | CalFire/DWR | Monterey Shale potential |
| 2025 | Madre Fire | San Luis Obispo | Grassland/Agriculture | Agriculture > Firefighting | CalFire/DWR | Monterey Shale potential |
| 2025 | Palisades Fire | Los Angeles | Urban/Wildland | Firefighting > Urban | CalFire/DWR | Monterey Shale potential |
| 2025 | Tule River Fire | Tule River Reservation | Tribal/Forest | Tribal > Firefighting | Tule River Tribe | No oil shale activity |
| 2025 | Addie Fire | Kern County | Grassland | Firefighting > Agriculture | CalFire | Monterey Shale potential |
| 2025 | Alpaugh Fire | Tulare County | Grassland | Firefighting > Agriculture | CalFire | No oil shale activity |

## Analysis
- **Water Impact**: Agriculture and oil shale (W7: 0.1-0.5 barrels water/barrel oil) prioritize water over firefighting (W3: Dixie Fire low accessibility), while tribal areas (Tule River, W3: 0 acre-feet) face limited allocation.
- **Land Use**: Urban areas (Palisades) prioritize firefighting, limiting burned area (38,690 acres); agricultural areas (Madre) compete for water, increasing area (80,779 acres).
- **Module Link**: Land use affects water allocation, reinforcing “water as the cause”; extinguishing agents (W6) supplement water in agricultural areas.
