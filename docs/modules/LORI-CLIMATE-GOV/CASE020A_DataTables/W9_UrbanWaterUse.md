# W9_UrbanWaterUse

## Description
Records urban water use and population served from 2020-2025, analyzing competition with firefighting water (W3) and CASE-020A’s urban vs. rural and safety vs. economy tensions, guided by LORI-CASE-020’s agriculture prioritization and climate justice.

## Data Table

| Year | Region | Total_Use_MAF | Population_Served | Source | Notes |
|------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| 2020 | Los Angeles | 2.0 | 10000000 | DWR UWMP 2020 | Drought restrictions |
| 2020 | Central Valley | 1.3 | 3000000 | DWR UWMP 2020 | High per-capita use |
| 2020 | San Francisco | 0.45 | 2800000 | DWR UWMP 2020 | Strong conservation |
| 2023 | Los Angeles | 1.9 | 10000000 | PPIC/DWR | Post-drought recovery |
| 2023 | Central Valley | 1.25 | 3000000 | PPIC/DWR | Stable demand |
| 2023 | San Francisco | 0.42 | 2800000 | PPIC/DWR | Efficiency gains |
| 2025 | Los Angeles | 1.8 | 10000000 | DWR UWMP 2025 | AB 1668 compliance |
| 2025 | Central Valley | 1.2 | 3000000 | DWR UWMP 2025 | Moderate conservation |
| 2025 | San Francisco | 0.4 | 2800000 | DWR UWMP 2025 | High efficiency |

## Analysis
- **Urban Competition**: Central Valley’s 1.2 MAF (2025) competes with firefighting (W3: Tule River, 0 acre-feet, 15,000 acres), while Los Angeles (1.8 MAF) and San Francisco (0.4 MAF) support fires (W3: Palisades, 16,000 acre-feet, 38,690 acres), reflecting CASE-020A’s urban vs. rural tension.
- **Agriculture Priority**: LORI-CASE-020’s agriculture prioritization suggests reallocating urban water to firefighting in fire-prone areas, prioritizing public safety (CASE-020A).
- **Climate Justice**: Tule River’s exclusion from urban water systems (W4, W5) highlights tribal inequities (LORI-CASE-020 ECJ).
- **Simulation Thread**: CASE-020A’s AI-based municipal water optimization could prioritize firefighting over urban use in fire-risk zones.
- **Oil Shale Link**: W7’s Monterey Shale (Palisades) exacerbates water competition, contributing to pressure issues (10% hydrants dry, [web:9]).
- **Module Link**: Urban water use impacts firefighting availability, reinforcing “water as the cause”; technology (W4, Phos-Chek, [web:6]) and AI optimization mitigate shortages.
- **Data Advisory**: 2025 data are projections; await CARB’s SB 253 regulations (July 1, 2025,) for urban water reporting clarity.[](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/02/californias-climate-disclosure-laws-navigating-the-latest-updates)
