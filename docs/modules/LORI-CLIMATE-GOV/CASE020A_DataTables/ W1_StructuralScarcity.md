## Description
Records structural water scarcity metrics (depletion rates, SGMA basin priorities, tribal water access) from 2020-2025, analyzing their impact on water availability for wildfire control, supporting the module theme “water as the cause, uncontrolled wildfires as the effect.”

## Data Table

| Year | Metric | Value | Source | Notes |
|------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| 2020 | Central Valley Depletion Rate | -10.2 km³/yr | DWR/USGS | Drought peak; heavy overdraft |
| 2020 | SGMA Basin Priority (Central Valley) | High/Medium | DWR Bulletin 118 | Initial GSP submissions |
| 2020 | Tribal Piped Water Access (Hoopa) | 45% | Hoopa Valley Tribe | Limited infrastructure |
| 2020 | Tribal Piped Water Access (Yurok) | 30% | Yurok Tribe | Shallow wells; contamination |
| 2020 | Tribal Piped Water Access (Tule River) | 58% | Tule River Tribe | Partial municipal connection |
| 2023 | Central Valley Depletion Rate | -6.5 km³/yr | DWR/USGS | Improved recharge; drought recovery |
| 2023 | SGMA Basin Priority (Central Valley) | High/Medium | DWR Bulletin 118 | 65 GSPs approved |
| 2023 | Tribal Piped Water Access (Hoopa) | 47% | Hoopa Valley Tribe | Incremental upgrades |
| 2023 | Tribal Piped Water Access (Yurok) | 31% | Yurok Tribe | Persistent contamination |
| 2023 | Tribal Piped Water Access (Tule River) | 60% | Tule River Tribe | Infrastructure gaps |
| 2025 | Central Valley Depletion Rate | +2.2 MAF | DWR/USGS | Net recharge in 2024; 2025 dryness risk |
| 2025 | SGMA Basin Priority (Central Valley) | High/Medium | DWR Bulletin 118 | 94 basins under GSPs |
| 2025 | Tribal Piped Water Access (Hoopa) | 48% | Hoopa Valley Tribe | Nitrate risk persists |
| 2025 | Tribal Piped Water Access (Yurok) | 32% | Yurok Tribe | Shallow wells; limited progress |
| 2025 | Tribal Piped Water Access (Tule River) | 62% | Tule River Tribe | Partial municipal upgrades |

## Analysis
- **Water Scarcity**: Central Valley depletion improved from -10.2 km³/yr (2020) to +2.2 MAF (2025), but tribal access (Tule River: 62%) remains low, limiting firefighting water (W3: Tule River Fire, 0 acre-feet, 15,000 acres burned).
- **SGMA Impact**: High/Medium priority basins (94 under GSPs by 2025) enhance recharge, supporting reservoirs (W3: Diamond Valley -3%), but dryness risks persist.
- **Tribal Equity**: Low access (Hoopa: 48%, Yurok: 32%) exacerbates water shortages in tribal areas, increasing wildfire vulnerability (W3: Tule River).
- **Module Link**: Structural scarcity restricts firefighting water, reinforcing “water as the cause”; technology (W6) and agents partially mitigate shortages.
