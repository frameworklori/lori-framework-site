# W3_FireConflict â€“ Public Fire Reserve Conflicts

## Overview
This table documents fire risk zones and reported conflicts over access to water reserves (hydrants, tanks) in rural and tribal regions of California during major wildfires from 2018 to 2025. It illustrates how agricultural water priorities have restricted emergency response in high-risk areas.

## Data Table

| Region | Major Fire (Year) | Conflict Type | Water Reserve Access (%) | Notes | Source |
|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Paradise, Butte | Camp Fire (2018) | Hydrant pressure failure | 60% | Insufficient backup; high fatality | CalFire, LA Times |
| San Joaquin Valley | Ag-Wildfire Overlap | Tanker access delayed by ag | 45% | Farm irrigation prioritized during heat waves | Cal OES, DWR |
| Kern County | 2022 Ridge Fire | Rural pump conflicts | 52% | Ag wells locked; tribal pump offline | Local reports |
| Tule River Area | 2025 KNP Complex Fire | Reserve vs. ag diversion | 38% | Firefighting hampered by ag pipe rerouting | Tule River Tribe |
