# W6_IndustrialWaterUse

## Description
Records industrial water use from 2020-2025, analyzing competition with firefighting water (W3) and oil shale (W7), focusing on CASE-020A’s industry vs. ecology tension and LORI-CASE-020’s agriculture prioritization.

## Data Table

| Year | Region | Industrial_Water_Use_MAF | Primary_Sector | Source | Notes |
|------|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| 2020 | Central Valley | 0.6 | Manufacturing/Mining | USGS 2020 | Stable demand |
| 2020 | Southern California | 0.4 | Manufacturing | USGS 2020 | Urban focus |
| 2023 | Central Valley | 0.55 | Manufacturing/Mining | PPIC/DWR | Post-drought efficiency |
| 2023 | Southern California | 0.35 | Manufacturing | PPIC/DWR | Conservation measures |
| 2025 | Central Valley | 0.5 | Manufacturing/Mining | DWR 2025 | AB 1668 compliance |
| 2025 | Southern California | 0.3 | Manufacturing | DWR 2025 | Urban efficiency |

## Analysis
- **Industrial Competition**: Central Valley’s 0.5 MAF (2025) competes with firefighting (W3: Tule River, 0 acre-feet, 15,000 acres), while Southern California’s lower use (0.3 MAF) supports fires (W3: Palisades, 16,000 acre-feet), reflecting CASE-020A’s industry vs. ecology tension.
- **Agriculture Priority**: LORI-CASE-020’s prioritization of agriculture over industrial sectors (e.g., manufacturing) suggests reallocating industrial water to firefighting in fire-prone areas.
- **Oil Shale Link**: W7’s Monterey Shale (0.1-0.5 barrels/barrel oil) adds to industrial demand, reducing firefighting water (Palisades, 10% hydrants dry, [web:9]), aligning with CASE-020A’s fire-season extraction limits.
- **Simulation Thread**: CASE-020A’s emergency override rules for industrial water during wildfire alerts could enhance firefighting capacity.
- **Module Link**: Industrial water use limits firefighting resources, reinforcing “water as the cause”; technology (W4, Phos-Chek, [web:6]) and AI optimization (CASE-020A) mitigate shortages.
- **Data Advisory**: 2025 data are projections; await CARB’s SB 253 regulations (July 1, 2025,) for industrial water reporting clarity.[](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/02/californias-climate-disclosure-laws-navigating-the-latest-updates)
