## Description
Records industrial water use from 2020-2025, analyzing competition with firefighting water (W3) and oil shale (W7).

## Data Table

| Year | Region | Industrial_Water_Use_MAF | Primary_Sector | Source | Notes |
|------|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| 2020 | Central Valley | 0.6 | Manufacturing/Mining | USGS 2020 | Stable demand |
| 2020 | Southern California | 0.4 | Manufacturing | USGS 2020 | Urban focus |
| 2023 | Central Valley | 0.55 | Manufacturing/Mining | PPIC/DWR | Post-drought efficiency |
| 2023 | Southern California | 0.35 | Manufacturing | PPIC/DWR | Conservation measures |
| 2025 | Central Valley | 0.5 | Manufacturing/Mining | DWR 2025 | AB 1668 compliance |
| 2025 | Southern California | 0.3 | Manufacturing | DWR 2025 | Urban efficiency |

## Analysis
- **Industrial Competition**: Central Valley’s 0.5 MAF (2025) competes with firefighting (W3: Tule River, 0 acre-feet), exacerbating shortages in tribal areas.
- **Southern California**: Lower use (0.3 MAF) supports firefighting (W3: Palisades, 16,000 acre-feet).
- **Oil Shale Link**: W7’s Monterey Shale (0.1-0.5 barrels/barrel oil) adds to industrial demand, reducing firefighting water.
- **Module Link**: Industrial use limits water availability, reinforcing “water as the cause”; technology (W4) mitigates shortages.
