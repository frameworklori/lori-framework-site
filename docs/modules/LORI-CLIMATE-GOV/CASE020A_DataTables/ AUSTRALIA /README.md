# CASE-020A – Australia Supplement (Bushfire × Water Ethics)

**Scope:** Adaptation of CASE-020A to Australia’s bushfire–water context.
**Focus states:** NSW, VIC, QLD, WA, SA, SE QLD corridor.
**Theme:** “Water as the cause, uncontrolled wildfires as the effect,” with emphasis on Aboriginal communities’ water access and peri-urban fire corridors.

- **Data:** `W3_FireConflict_AUS.csv`
- **What it contains:** Major bushfire events, affected water sources, reserve changes, emergency releases (ML), wind/meteorology, accessibility, and community notes.
- **Notes:** 2019–2020 *Black Summer* used as baseline. 2024–2025 rows marked *Projection* for planning.

### W4 – Reclaimed Water Systems (Australia)

- **What it contains:** Recycled water share, treatment level, “purple pipe” length, delivery volume (GL) for Adelaide, Perth, Sydney, Melbourne, SE QLD, Adelaide Hills.
- **Use:** Aligns with CASE-020A W4 for targeting reuse to fire-risk corridors.

### (Optional) W1 – Structural Water Scarcity (Australia)
- **Data:** `W1_StructuralScarcity_AUS.csv`
- **What it contains:** MDB storage change, inland groundwater stress, restriction tiers, aquifer-recharge pilots, Aboriginal community water reliability (qualitative).

### (Optional) W5 – Household Water Use (Australia)

- Do **not** include precise dam/standpipe coordinates in public CSVs.
