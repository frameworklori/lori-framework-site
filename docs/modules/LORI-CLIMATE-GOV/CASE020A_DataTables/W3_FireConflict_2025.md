# W3_FireConflict_2025.csv – Fire Emergency Reserve Systems (2024–2025 Update)

## Overview
This dataset supplements the original `W3_FireConflict.csv`, focusing specifically on **fire emergency reserve infrastructure, reservoir accessibility, and tribal equity risks** during the 2024–2025 period. It supports the ECJ × RIM validation layer for CASE-020A.

| Metric | Value | Source | Year | Notes |
|----------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|------|-------|
| Palisades Fire (LA) Hydrant Failures | 10% hydrants dry | CalFire / LA Times | 2025 | Infrastructure strain; 38,690 acres burned |
| Diamond Valley Reservoir Capacity | 97% full | DWR | 2025 | Southern CA; supports urban fire needs |
| San Luis Reservoir Capacity | 81% full | DWR | 2025 | Jointly operated; storm flex pumping |
| Sierra Foothills Drawdown Risk | High | CalFire / DWR | 2025 | Limited access; 85% SWE in Southern Sierra |
| Tribal Lands (Tule River) Access | <20% | Tule River Tribe | 2025 | High-risk; underfunded infrastructure |
| CalFire Prioritized Zones | Urban focus | CalFire Zone Maps | 2025 | Rural/tribal areas deprioritized |
| DWR Drought Reserve Releases | 16,000 acre-feet | DWR | 2025 | Storm flex to San Luis; tribal exclusion |

## Ethical Highlights
- **Tribal Infrastructure Gap**: Tule River tribal lands report <20% reservoir access during fire season.
- **Urban-Rural Equity Imbalance**: CalFire’s prioritization of urban zones results in deprioritized emergency water support for rural and tribal regions.
- **Reservoir Strain**: Seasonal drought releases from DWR disproportionately benefit urban zones, with limited offsetting measures for tribal land resiliency.
