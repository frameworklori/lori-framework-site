## Description
Records agricultural vs. tribal water allocation from 2020-2025, analyzing competition impacting firefighting water (W3), linked to the module theme.

## Data Table

| Year | Metric | Value | Source | Notes |
|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|--------|---------------------------|
| 2020 | Agricultural Water Use | 42% (80% dry years) | PPIC | Central Valley dominance |
| 2020 | Almond Acreage Increase | 70% | USDA | High water footprint |
| 2020 | Tribal Allocation (Hoopa) | 0.7% surface water | Hoopa Valley Tribe | Subordinated to agriculture |
| 2020 | Tribal Allocation (Yurok) | 0.6% surface water | Yurok Tribe | Legal disputes |
| 2020 | Tribal Allocation (Tule River) | 1.0% surface water | Tule River Tribe | Limited enforcement |
| 2023 | Agricultural Water Use | 41% (78% dry years) | PPIC | Post-drought stabilization |
| 2023 | Almond Acreage Increase | 75% | USDA | Continued expansion |
| 2023 | Tribal Allocation (Hoopa) | 0.75% surface water | Hoopa Valley Tribe | Minor gains |
| 2023 | Tribal Allocation (Yurok) | 0.65% surface water | Yurok Tribe | Ongoing disputes |
| 2023 | Tribal Allocation (Tule River) | 1.1% surface water | Tule River Tribe | Infrastructure limits |
| 2025 | Agricultural Water Use | 40% (80% dry years) | PPIC | Stable high demand |
| 2025 | Almond Acreage Increase | 78% | USDA | 523 billion gallons added |
| 2025 | Tribal Allocation (Hoopa) | 0.8% surface water | Hoopa Valley Tribe | Subordinated priority |
| 2025 | Tribal Allocation (Yurok) | 0.7% surface water | Yurok Tribe | Legal barriers |
| 2025 | Tribal Allocation (Tule River) | 1.2% surface water | Tule River Tribe | Limited enforcement |

## Analysis
- **Water Competition**: Agriculture (40-80% of water, 2025) and almond expansion (78%, 523B gallons) outprioritize tribal allocations (Tule River: 1.2%), limiting firefighting water (W3: Tule River, 0 acre-feet).
- **Impact on Fires**: Agricultural demand reduces reservoir availability (W3: Tule River -12%), increasing burned areas in tribal regions (15,000 acres).
- **Module Link**: Agricultural water dominance reinforces “water as the cause”; tribal areas rely on extinguishing agents (W6) due to low water access.
