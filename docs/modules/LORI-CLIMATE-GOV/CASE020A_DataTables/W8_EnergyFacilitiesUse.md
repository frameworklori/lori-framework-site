# W8_EnergyFacilitiesUse

## Description
Records energy sector water use (thermoelectric, hydroelectric) from 2020-2025, analyzing competition with firefighting water (W3) and CASE-020A’s industry vs. ecology tension, guided by LORI-CASE-020’s agriculture prioritization.

## Data Table

| Year | Metric | Value | Source | Notes |
|------|---------------------------|--------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| 2020 | Thermoelectric Water Use | 13% total (41 Bgal/d) | USGS 2020 | Mostly saline; CA ~10% |
| 2020 | Hydroelectric Cooling Use | <1% total | USGS 2020 | Minimal impact |
| 2020 | CA Energy Sector Total | 1.6 MAF | DWR 2020 | Includes thermoelectric/hydro |
| 2023 | Thermoelectric Water Use | 12% total | USGS/DWR | Stable saline use |
| 2023 | Hydroelectric Cooling Use | <1% total | USGS/DWR | Minimal impact |
| 2023 | CA Energy Sector Total | 1.55 MAF | DWR 2023 | Slight efficiency gains |
| 2025 | Thermoelectric Water Use | 13% total | USGS/DWR | Mostly saline |
| 2025 | Hydroelectric Cooling Use | <1% total | USGS/DWR | Minimal impact |
| 2025 | CA Energy Sector Total | 1.5 MAF | DWR 2025 | Stable demand |

## Analysis
- **Energy Competition**: Energy sector’s 1.5 MAF (2025) has minimal freshwater impact due to saline use but competes in low-access areas (W3: Tule River, 0 acre-feet, 15,000 acres), reflecting CASE-020A’s industry vs. ecology tension.
- **Agriculture Priority**: LORI-CASE-020’s agriculture prioritization suggests reallocating energy sector water to firefighting during fire season (CASE-020A simulation thread).
- **Urban Support**: Urban areas (W3: Palisades, 16,000 acre-feet, 38,690 acres) benefit from saline use, limiting competition.
- **Simulation Thread**: CASE-020A’s emergency override rules for energy facilities during wildfire alerts could enhance firefighting capacity.
- **Module Link**: Energy water use marginally affects firefighting, reinforcing “water as the cause”; technology (W4, Phos-Chek, [web:6]) and AI optimization (CASE-020A) mitigate shortages.
- **Data Advisory**: 2025 data are projections; await CARB’s SB 253 regulations (July 1, 2025,) for energy water reporting clarity.[](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2025/02/californias-climate-disclosure-laws-navigating-the-latest-updates)
