## Description
Records energy sector water use (thermoelectric, hydroelectric) from 2020-2025, analyzing competition with firefighting water (W3).

## Data Table

| Year | Metric | Value | Source | Notes |
|------|---------------------------|--------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| 2020 | Thermoelectric Water Use | 13% total (41 Bgal/d) | USGS 2020 | Mostly saline; CA ~10% |
| 2020 | Hydroelectric Cooling Use | <1% total | USGS 2020 | Minimal impact |
| 2020 | CA Energy Sector Total | 1.6 MAF | DWR 2020 | Includes thermoelectric/hydro |
| 2023 | Thermoelectric Water Use | 12% total | USGS/DWR | Stable saline use |
| 2023 | Hydroelectric Cooling Use | <1% total | USGS/DWR | Minimal impact |
| 2023 | CA Energy Sector Total | 1.55 MAF | DWR 2023 | Slight efficiency gains |
| 2025 | Thermoelectric Water Use | 13% total | USGS/DWR | Mostly saline |
| 2025 | Hydroelectric Cooling Use | <1% total | USGS/DWR | Minimal impact |
| 2025 | CA Energy Sector Total | 1.5 MAF | DWR 2025 | Stable demand |

## Analysis
- **Energy Competition**: Energy sector’s 1.5 MAF (2025) competes with firefighting (W3: Tule River, 0 acre-feet), though saline use reduces freshwater impact.
- **Fire Impact**: Minimal competition in urban areas (W3: Palisades, 16,000 acre-feet), but tribal areas face shortages (W1: Tule River, 62% access).
- **Module Link**: Energy water use marginally affects firefighting, reinforcing “water as the cause”; technology (W4) mitigates shortages.
