## Description
Records wildfire data (burned area, water use, wind impact) from 1910-2025, focusing on water resource management’s role in fire control, central to the module theme “water as the cause, uncontrolled wildfires as the effect.”

## Data Table

| Year | Fire Name | Location | Burned Area (acres) | Water Source Affected | Reserve Volume Change (%) | Accessibility Status | Emergency Water Release (acre-feet) | Cause | Wind Impact | Source | Notes |
|------|------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1910 | Great Fire | Idaho/Montana/Washington | 3000000 | Unknown rivers | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | Lightning+Human | High (70 mph hurricane winds, increased fire spread) | USFS Historical Records | Destructive firestorm; no modern water management |
| 2021 | Dixie Fire | Plumas/Butte | 963309 | Lake Oroville | -15 | Low | 12000 | Human | High (Santa Ana winds, increased evaporation and pressure issues) | CalFire/DWR | Power line; largest 2021 fire |

| 2025 | Alpaugh Fire | Tulare County | 3000 | Tule River | -3 | Low | 0 | Natural | Moderate (20-40 mph, increased evaporation) | CalFire | Lightning; estimated data |

## Analysis
- **Water Management**: 1910 lacked water management (3M acres burned); 2025 high accessibility (Palisades: 16,000 acre-feet) limited area to 38,690 acres, while low accessibility (Tule River: 0 acre-feet) resulted in 15,000 acres.
- **Wind Impact**: High winds (1910: 70 mph, 2025 Palisades: 50-80 mph, [web:9]) increase evaporation and pressure issues (10% hydrants dry, July 17 note).
- **Oil Shale**: W7 shows Monterey Shale (Palisades) competes for water, exacerbating pressure issues.
- **Module Link**: Water is the primary driver; extinguishing agents (W4) and technology (W6) enhance control in low-access areas.
