# W3_FireConflict_Expanded

## Description
Records wildfire data (burned area, water use, wind impact) from 1910-2025, analyzing water resource management’s role in fire control amidst ethical tensions (CASE-020A: safety vs. economy, urban vs. rural). Aligns with the module theme “water as the cause, uncontrolled wildfires as the effect,” emphasizing public safety prioritization and tribal inequities (LORI-CASE-020 ECJ).

## Data Table

| Year | Fire Name | Location | Burned Area (acres) | Water Source Affected | Reserve Volume Change (%) | Accessibility Status | Emergency Water Release (acre-feet) | Cause | Wind Impact | Source | Notes |
|------|------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1910 | Great Fire | Idaho/Montana/Washington | 3000000 | Unknown rivers | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | Lightning+Human | High (70 mph hurricane winds, increased fire spread) | USFS Historical Records | Destructive firestorm; no modern water management |
| 2021 | Dixie Fire | Plumas/Butte | 963309 | Lake Oroville | -15 | Low | 12000 | Human | High (Santa Ana winds, increased evaporation and pressure issues) | CalFire/DWR | Power line; largest 2021 fire |
| 2025 | Madre Fire | San Luis Obispo | 80779 | Santa Margarita Lake | -10 | Medium | 8000 | Human | Moderate (20-40 mph, increased evaporation) | CalFire/DWR | Arson suspected |
| 2025 | Palisades Fire | Los Angeles | 38690 | Diamond Valley | -3 | High | 16000 | Human | High (50-80 mph Santa Ana winds, increased evaporation and pressure issues) | CalFire/DWR | Arson; 10% hydrants dry |
| 2025 | Tule River Fire | Tule River Reservation | 15000 | Tule River | -12 | Low | 0 | Natural | Moderate (20-40 mph, increased evaporation) | Tule River Tribe | Lightning; no tribal release |
| 2025 | Addie Fire | Kern County | 5000 | Kern River | -5 | Medium | 2000 | Human | Moderate (20-40 mph, increased evaporation) | CalFire | Grassland fire; estimated data |
| 2025 | Alpaugh Fire | Tulare County | 3000 | Tule River | -3 | Low | 0 | Natural | Moderate (20-40 mph, increased evaporation) | CalFire | Lightning; estimated data |

## Analysis
- **Water Management**: High water accessibility (Palisades: 16,000 acre-feet, 38,690 acres burned) contrasts with tribal areas (Tule River: 0 acre-feet, 15,000 acres), reflecting CASE-020A’s urban vs. rural tension and LORI-CASE-020’s climate justice focus on underserved communities.
- **Wind Impact**: High winds (1910: 70 mph, 2025 Palisades: 50-80 mph Santa Ana) exacerbate evaporation and pressure issues (10% hydrants dry, [web:9]), reducing firefighting efficiency.
- **Oil Shale Competition**: W7’s Monterey Shale (0.1-0.5 barrels/barrel oil) competes with firefighting (Palisades), aligning with CASE-020A’s safety vs. economy dilemma and proposed fire-season extraction limits.
- **Technology**: Extinguishing agents (Phos-Chek, W4) and AI-optimized firefighting routes (CASE-020A simulation thread) reduce burned areas in low-access regions (Addie/Alpaugh: 5,000/3,000 acres).
- **Module Link**: Water scarcity drives wildfire outcomes; tribal inequities (LORI-CASE-020 ECJ) and oil shale competition (W7) amplify shortages, while technology (W4) and AI optimization mitigate constraints, reinforcing “water as the cause.”
- **Data Advisory**: 2025 data (Madre, Palisades, Tule River, Addie, Alpaugh) are projections; tribal data may be underreported.
