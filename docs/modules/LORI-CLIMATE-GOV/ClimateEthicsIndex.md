# Climate Ethics Index (CEI)

## Purpose
The CEI measures the moral implications and social fairness of climate-related decisions, technologies, and interventions, focusing on distributive impact, agency, and transparency.

## Core Dimensions
| Dimension | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Intergenerational Justice | Impact on future generations’ survivability |
| Species Fairness | Impact on non-human life and biodiversity |
| Geographic Equity | Burden shared between Global North and South |
| Economic Stratification | Protection of bottom-tier populations |
| Transparency & Consent | Public participation in major interventions |

## Rating System
Each policy or project is scored on a 0–5 scale in each dimension.

### Example: Solar Geoengineering
| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|------------------------|-------|-------|
| Intergenerational Justice | 2 | Long-term unknown risks |
| Species Fairness | 1 | Could disrupt ecosystems |
| Geographic Equity | 2 | May affect rainfall in Global South |
| Economic Stratification | 1 | Poorer regions lack decision power |
| Transparency & Consent | 0 | No global vote or consent system |

**Total CEI Risk Level: HIGH**

## Integration
Used by `CIP`, `CBL`, and `UFI` modules for pre-intervention ethical clearance.
