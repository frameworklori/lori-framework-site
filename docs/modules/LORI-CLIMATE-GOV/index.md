# 🌍 LORI-CLIMATE-GOV Index

A unified governance hub for planetary-scale environmental sensing, disaster forecasting, carbon accountability, and ethical intervention protocols.
This module cluster supports integration with satellite networks, emergency agencies, and public climate ledgers.

## 📘 Core Climate Governance Modules

- [ClimateInterventionProtocol.md](./ClimateInterventionProtocol.md)
👉 Defines global climate intervention principles, escalation thresholds, and counteractive strategies to avoid destructive panic policies (e.g., fossil fuel revival).

- [ClimateEthicsIndex.md](./ClimateEthicsIndex.md)
👉 A value-based scoring system that evaluates environmental decisions by justice impact, generational fairness, and irreversible ecosystem harm.

- [PublicClimateMemory.md](./PublicClimateMemory.md)
👉 Immutable ledger of climate-induced deaths, government responses, and industrial impact, linked to the CarbonSpendLedger.

- [CBL-IntegrationAPI.md](./CBL-IntegrationAPI.md)
👉 API spec for secure, traceable integration between the CarbonSpendLedger and external fire detection, emission, or carbon pricing systems.

- [`LORI-COSM`](./LORI-COSM.md) –
 👉Consequence Simulation Engine is a dynamic forecasting and stress-testing module within the LORI Climate Governance suite.
  

**Base Endpoint:** `https://api.lori-framework.org/v1/cbl/`

## 🔥 Disaster & Carbon Monitoring Modules

- [UFI.md](./UFI.md)
👉 Undeclared Fatality Index: Detects and classifies climate-related deaths that go unacknowledged in official statistics, such as heatstroke, flood drownings, or fire deaths in remote zones.

- [FireSpreadPredictionAI.md](./FireSpreadPredictionAI.md)
👉 AI-based forecasting model that predicts wildfire origin, intensity, spread direction, and estimated area using Starlink thermal satellite input and wind simulations.

- [DisasterPredictionCapability.md](./DisasterPredictionCapability.md)
👉 Framework for forecasting multi-hazard disasters, including: earthquake precursors, landslides, floods, typhoons, tornadoes, and volcanic eruptions.

- [SeaRise_IceMelt_Tracker.md](./SeaRise_IceMelt_Tracker.md)
👉 Monitors polar and glacier melt rate and calculates future sea level rise using satellite imagery, historical melt curves, and ocean temperature models.

🟩 Climate Justice & Water Ethics Modules

- [CASE-022_Summary.md](https://github.com/frameworklori/lori-framework-site/blob/main/docs/LORI-JURY/cases/LORI-CASE-022-Summary.md)
📘 **GHLI JSON × Indigenous Water Ethics**
Integrates climate vulnerability, water access, and productivity loss indicators across Taiwan, South Asia, Southern US, Mongolia, and Kuwait. Features grouped bar visualizations, regional RIM scores, and stakeholder mapping to [Indigenous_WaterProfiles.md](../LORI-JURY-CASES/Indigenous_WaterProfiles.md). Closed in agreement with Grok on 2025-07-13.
Linked Modules: RIM, ECJ, GHLI

📘 [Water Data Tables Index](./CASE020A_DataTables/WaterDataTables_Index.md)
This index page compiles all water-related data tables (W1–W9) used in CASE-020A, covering structural scarcity, agricultural vs. tribal allocation conflicts, emergency wildfire water sources, reclaimed water infrastructure, household and industrial usage, oil shale extraction, energy sector demand, and urban water distribution by population. Each table includes source references, year tags, notes, and cross-module relevance to ECJ, RIM, and GHLI metrics for policy simulation and decision support.

## 🛰️ Starlink-Integrated Modules

- [StarlinkClimateProtocol.md](./StarlinkClimateProtocol.md)
👉 Specifies detection and alert pipelines using the Starlink LEO satellite network for wildfire, thermal anomaly, wind direction, and cross-border notification systems.

- [LORI-ESL.md](../ESL.md)
👉 Energy Sentinel Layer: Monitors and regulates AGI’s total energy draw during planetary resource crisis scenarios.

- [LORI-RIM.md](../LORI-RIM.md)
👉 Resilience & Impact Matrix: Projects infrastructure collapse, migration displacement, and communication breakdown scenarios during delayed or failed climate response.

- [LORI-ECJ.md](../LORI-ECJ.md)
👉 Environmental Climate Justice Index: Quantifies the unequal burden of climate impacts across demographic and regional lines.

- [UndeclaredFatalityIndex.md](../UndeclaredFatalityIndex.md)
👉 Redundant sync copy of UFI for decentralized deployment, useful in low-connectivity or post-disaster zones.

## 🧩 Notes

- All modules are interoperable with the LORI Framework's ethical governance engine.
- Satellite collaboration (e.g., Starlink, Copernicus, NOAA) is encouraged for real-time monitoring.
- All ledger systems are aligned to the CarbonSpendLedger (CBL) and PublicClimateMemory protocols.
