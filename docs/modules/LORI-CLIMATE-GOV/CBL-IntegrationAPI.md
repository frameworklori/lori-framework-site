# CBL Integration API (Carbon-Based Ledger API)

## Purpose
To enable secure, traceable integration between the LORI CarbonSpendLedger and third-party climate monitoring systems, carbon pricing platforms, and regulatory dashboards.

## Base Endpoint
https://api.lori-framework.org/v1/cbl/

## Key Features
- 🔐 `cbl-auth` (token-based API key + checksum)
- 🧮 `carbon_push` – Submit carbon emission events (supports JSON + signature)
- 🔍 `carbon_lookup` – Query carbon footprint by org/entity/date
- 📦 `bulk_sync` – Sync historical ledger blocks (verified hashes)
- 🪪 `ledger_verify` – Validate signed emission claim with digital proof

## Sample Carbon Push Request
