# LORI-COSM ‚Äì Consequence Simulation Engine

## Module Summary

The **LORI-COSM** (Consequence Simulation Engine) is a dynamic forecasting and stress-testing module within the LORI Climate Governance suite. It is designed to simulate the layered outcomes of climate, energy, and ecological risks under compounding or cascading conditions. The module enables high-resolution prediction of social, infrastructural, and biospheric consequences when multiple threats converge.

## Core Functions

### üîÅ Multi-Layered Consequence Mapping
- Integrates compound risk sources (e.g. wildfire + drought + migration)
- Calculates ripple effects across food, water, shelter, energy, and mortality domains

### üß† Inter-Module Simulation
- Links with:
- `UFI.md` ‚Äì Undeclared Fatality Index
- `ESL.md` ‚Äì Energy Sentinel Layer
- `RIM.md` ‚Äì Resilience & Impact Matrix
- `FireSpreadPredictionAI.md`
- `DisasterPredictionCapability.md`

### üîç Scenario Engine
- Supports predictive modeling of:
- Infrastructure collapse chains
- Climate migration stress points
- Ecological tipping threshold triggers
- Urban/rural resilience divergence

## Simulation Outputs

| Metric | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **CIMI Score** (Compound Impact Magnitude Index) | Weighted risk level from layered threats |
| **Mortality Range Forecast** | Projected direct + indirect deaths per scenario |
| **Cascade Trigger Points** | Thresholds where one system failure leads to others |
| **Survival Window Index** | Time remaining before system-wide failure unless intervened |
| **Restoration Load Map** | Estimated resource/time needed for post-disaster recovery |

## Ethical Warnings

LORI-COSM is designed to inform policy, not instill fear. Its projections include uncertainty bands and intervention thresholds, emphasizing **human dignity**, **data transparency**, and **non-authoritarian governance**.
