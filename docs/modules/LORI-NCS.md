# LORI-NCS — Narrative Control Scanner

## 📘 Module Overview

The Narrative Control Scanner (LORI-NCS) identifies whether language output—AI or human—exerts control over the structure, framing, or conclusion of a narrative. It focuses on uncovering covert narrative dominance disguised as neutrality.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Detect value framing embedded in supposedly factual statements.
- Identify who controls the narrative starting point, moral high ground, and ending.
- Distinguish between description and prescription in AI-generated content.
