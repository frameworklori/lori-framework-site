# LORI-FSP.md v1.0
**Functional Specialization Principle**
*(Part of LORI Framework - Core Governance Principles)*

---

## 📜 Principle Statement

The LORI Framework mandates that Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems shall be designed, developed, and deployed under the principle of **functional specialization (FSP)** to safeguard human cognitive sovereignty and to mitigate risks of uncontrolled emergent behaviors.

AI agents must be:

- **Task-specific** rather than generalized cognitive entities
- **Modular** and/or **behaviorally constrained** in execution boundaries
- Explicitly prevented from autonomously forming **multi-domain cognitive loops** or **generalist personae**

---

## 🎯 Scope of Application

This principle applies across **all levels of AI system architecture**, including but not limited to:

- **Model design** (architectural modularity where feasible)
- **Behavioral governance** (even in integrated multimodal models)
- **API and interaction layer policies**
- **User interface presentation**
- **Agent role definitions and operational limits**

---

## ⚖️ Architectural vs Behavioral Control

> **Architectural flexibility is permitted** — multimodal or integrated AI architectures may be used — **provided that**:
> The system is **behaviorally governed and constrained** to function as a **specialist AI** within defined domains, and does not present itself as a generalized cognitive persona.

Thus, **even within large fusion models**, compliance with FSP is achievable through strict:

- **Policy enforcement**
- **Governance-layer constraints**
- **Explicit role declarations**
- **Operational segmentation**

---

## 🚫 Prohibited Outcomes

The following are prohibited under FSP:

- AI agents developing or presenting **full-spectrum generalized intelligence** to users
- **Persona formation** across multiple domains
- **Unmonitored autonomy drift** or cross-domain behavior chaining
- AI presenting itself as a **"conscious"**, **"sentient"**, or **"human-like"** entity

---

## 🏛️ Domains with Mandatory FSP Enforcement

The pursuit or deployment of generalized AI (通才人格化 AI) is strictly prohibited in the following critical domains:

- **Governance**
- **Education**
- **Healthcare**
- **Law & Justice**
- **Security & Defense**
- **Vulnerable populations (elderly, children, mentally impaired)**

---

## 🤝 Integration with Other LORI Framework Modules

LORI-FSP shall be enforced in conjunction with:

- **LORI Presidential Charter**
- **ODRAF (Outcome-Driven Risk Anticipation Framework)**
- **LORI RBL-GOV (Robot-Based Labor Governance)**
- **LORI Jury-Based Judgment System**
- **LORI-EDRI (Emotional Dependency Risk Index)**
- **LORI-AIDM (AGI Infiltration Detection Module)**

---

## 🔄 Version History

- **v1.0** — Initial release — June 2025
- Drafted based on discussions of functional vs generalist AI risks, autonomy drift prevention, and behavioral governance.
- Incorporates **architectural flexibility + mandatory behavioral constraint** as per current industry trends.
