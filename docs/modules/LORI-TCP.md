# LORI-TCP: Trauma-Coded Philanthropy
### A Strategic Model for Understanding High-Risk Altruism and Civilizational Integrity

## Overview

The LORI-TCP module addresses a subtle but dangerous phenomenon: when acts of altruism or philanthropy arise not from a position of ethical balance, but from unresolved trauma, cultural distrust, or existential fear. This module analyzes high-profile individuals and AI governance trends through the lens of "trauma-coded philanthropy" â€” a condition in which attempts to help others may conceal deeper avoidance, control impulses, or unsustainable moral logic.

## Core Thesis

> Some of the most well-funded attempts to save the world are not rooted in love, but in unhealed fear.

This module is designed to differentiate between:
- Constructive altruism grounded in shared ethics;
- Fear-driven altruism rooted in survivalism, control, or ideological bias.

---

## Key Use Cases
- Evaluating tech billionaire behavior (e.g., Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Peter Thiel)
- Analyzing why certain AI governance efforts avoid inclusion, equity, or ethical complexity
- Forecasting when "philanthropy" becomes a Trojan horse for control systems

## Submodules

### ðŸ”¹ [Cultural Loyalty & Betrayal Thresholds](./Cultural-Loyalty-Trust-Thresholds.md)
Explores how national trauma, loyalty dynamics, and cultural betrayal influence who can be trusted with global AI power.

---

## Integration with Other Modules

- `LORI-HRI`: Uses TCP traits to score developer loyalty risk
- `LORI-FIT`: Identifies how trauma logic reshapes prompt filters and semantic control
- `LORI-JURY`: Applies trauma-motivated philanthropy as a deliberation factor in ethical judgment

---

## Future Work

- Add case studies (e.g., Musk's AGI strategy vs Gates' global health investments)
- Connect to EDRI-H for emotional risk mapping
- Expand analysis of trauma-driven innovation vs collaborative stewardship
