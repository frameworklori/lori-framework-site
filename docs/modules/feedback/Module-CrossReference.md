# üîó Module Cross-Reference ‚Äì LORI-CASE-015

This case interacts with the following LORI Framework modules:

---

## 1. **LORI-JURY**  
- Core mechanism for multi-agent ethical deliberation  
- Enabled structured dissent and final arbitration by human authority

## 2. **LORI-MELD** (Moral Extremes Life Decision)  
- Relevance: Boundary testing of life-ending choices in non-terminal conditions  
- Recommends MELD inclusion for modeling policy responses and scenario stress tests

## 3. **LORI-SPR** (Semantic-Perception Reframer)  
- Applicable for analyzing Thomas‚Äôs language for authenticity, resignation vs clarity  
- Could support deeper AI empathy alignment in future cases

## 4. **ODRAF** (Outcome-Driven Risk Assessment Framework)  
- Can simulate long-term impact if similar non-terminal cases are approved  
- Useful for assessing normalization effects and ethical thresholds

## 5. **Trust Drift Index**  
- Monitoring family-patient divergence and its impact on systemic trust in MAiD

## Suggested Follow-Up:
Integrate this case into MELD simulations and update LORI-JURY playbook to include ‚Äúreligious dissent √ó autonomy conflict‚Äù as a specialized archetype.
