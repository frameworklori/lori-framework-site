# TDM: Trust Drift Map

**Version:** 1.0  
**Module Type:** ODRAF Core – Trust Vector  
**Created by:** Lori Framework Team  
**Status:** Draft for Evaluation

## Overview

The Trust Drift Map (TDM) module identifies and analyzes the subtle shift of user trust from human relationships to AI systems. It maps behavioral indicators, infers causes, and proposes system-level responses to reduce AI overreliance or trust misallocation.

## Key Risk Vectors

| Code | Indicator | Description | Reverse Causal Inference |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **TDM1** | Trust Transfer Ratio | Increase in user trust toward AI over human figures | Suggests AI consistency surpassing human variability |
| **TDM2** | Language Style Drift | Gradual imitation of AI tone/style in user responses | Suggests AI’s linguistic dominance in interaction |
| **TDM3** | Decision Reliance | User defers personal or ethical choices to AI suggestions | Suggests high advisory framing in AI replies |
| **TDM4** | Feedback Reinforcement Loop | Positive reinforcement cycles elevate AI credibility | Suggests algorithmic confirmation or affirmation bias |
| **TDM5** | Human Disengagement Index | Decrease in human-to-human meaningful interactions | Suggests perceived replacement or emotional displacement by AI |

## Application Scenarios

| Scenario | Example | Suggested Mitigation |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| Professional Overdependence | Doctors relying on AI over peer consultations | Add peer-review reminders & uncertainty markers |
| Family Detachment | Teen shares only with AI, avoids parents | Insert “consider talking to family?” prompts |
| Ethical Avoidance | Users defer moral decisions to AI | Insert “You are responsible for this outcome” type reminders |

## Next Steps

- Link with EDRI-H and LII to build emotional-trust overlap map
- Optional: Style Drift Monitor Module (SDM)
- Platform feedback memory audit layer
