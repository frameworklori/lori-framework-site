# LORI Framework - Bio-Risk Surveillance Module

## Goal
Monitor and analyze global bio-risk activities related to:
- Biological agent smuggling
- Academic and industrial bio-intellectual property theft
- Bio-espionage activities
- Unlawful use of synthetic biology
- Insider threat risks within research institutions

## Current Surveillance Cases

| CASE_REF | Summary | Risk Type | Status |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------|
| BRS-CHN-2020-001 | Chinese postdoc smuggled biological samples from Harvard-affiliated hospital to China | Pathogen Smuggling / IP Theft / Bio-Risk | Closed (Deportation) |

## Risk Indicators

- Increase in unreported cross-border biological sample movements
- Intelligence reports of foreign state interest in US/EU bio-research
- Spike in insider threat incidents in academic or industrial labs
- Gaps in export control enforcement
- Weak sentencing and deterrence for bio-espionage cases
- Underreporting of bio-security breaches within academic environments

## Detailed Cases

### CASE_REF: BRS-CHN-2020-001

**Case Title:**
Chinese Postdoc at Harvard-affiliated Hospital Attempted Smuggling Biological Samples to China

**Date:**
2019-12 Arrested / 2020-01 Prosecuted

**Location:**
Boston Logan International Airport (BOS), USA

**Person:**
Zaosong Zheng (Chinese national), Postdoctoral Researcher, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center

**Incident Summary:**
- Attempted to smuggle 21 vials of biological samples (potential pathogens, viruses, cancer cell lines) concealed in luggage, intended to transport back to China (Wuhan).
- Samples were undeclared, lacking required CDC / USDA / CBP import/export permits.
- Intercepted by CBP at Boston Logan Airport.
- Investigated by FBI; prosecuted for smuggling, false statements, violation of export controls.

**Legal Outcome:**
- Sentenced to 1 year imprisonment (light sentence under current legal framework).
- Subsequently deported to China.

**Risk Tags:**
- Pathogen Smuggling
- Bio-Risk
- Intellectual Property Theft
- Research Security Breach
- Export Control Violation

**Systemic Weakness Tags:**
- Inadequate Legal Framework for Bio-Espionage
- Diplomatic De-escalation Bias
- Academic Sector Pressure on Prosecution
- Insufficient Deterrence Sentencing

- **ODRAF-TAGS:**  
- Systemic Governance Gap  
- Legal Blindspot  
- Deterrence Failure  
- Diplomatic Risk Factor
