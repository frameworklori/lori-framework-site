## üìò Module Purpose

The Equity Compensation Index (ECI) aims to restore civic trust by ensuring that native-born citizens‚Äîespecially in high-immigrant-load communities‚Äîare visibly and meaningfully compensated for the systemic burdens imposed by undocumented migration and legalization programs. The goal is to prevent incentive imbalance and societal resentment from eroding long-term democratic stability.

## üß† Core Principle

> "When the rewards of illegality surpass the burdens of legality, civic trust collapses."

Therefore, the ECI provides mechanisms to rebalance public perception of fairness, fiscal justice, and earned citizenship by designing direct or indirect compensations for lawful contributors.

|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Local Immigrant Social Load** | Ratio of undocumented population to legal residents in a district | Tax credits or public service offsets to lawful residents |
| **Public Service Overuse Index** | Volume of education, ER, housing used by undocumented populations | Additional federal aid packages to those municipalities |
| **Civic Contribution Loyalty Score** | Continuous lawful tax filing, no criminal record, service participation | Priority access to educational subsidies, healthcare credits |
| **Long-Term Fiscal Strain Index** | Historical rise in local taxation due to undocumented absorption | Property tax relief or housing interest subsidies |
