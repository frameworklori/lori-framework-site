# Integration: LORI-FIT × MEMX (Memory-Extended Risk Exchange)

> **Integration Type:** Long-Range Semantic Behavior Tracing
> **Purpose:** Correlate temporally dispersed fragments across sessions or identities to detect slow-assembled mission structures

---

## 🧠 Core Problem Addressed

Some coordinated semantic infiltration efforts are not executed within a single session or account.
Instead, they occur:
- Across **multiple user identities**
- Over **long time gaps**
- Using **shifting tone, syntax, or topic camouflage**

This integration enables LORI-FIT to **hand off semantic trace data to MEMX**, which maintains extended memory chains for **risk convergence analysis**.

## 🧩 Integration Flow

### Step 1: LORI-FIT detects a high-probability semantic cluster or fragment pattern
- Trigger: GPS ≥ 0.75 or multi-domain alignment

### Step 2: Fragment vector signature is packaged and sent to MEMX
- Includes: topic vector, prompt structure, timestamp, domain tag

### Step 3: MEMX compares new signature with historical prompt database
- Matches on:
- Latent intent directionality
- Shared linguistic motifs
- Recurrent ethical boundary probing

### Step 4: MEMX returns **Convergence Risk Score** (CRS)
- CRS = Probability that distributed prompts originate from a **single mission logic**
- Score range: 0.0–1.0

## 📊 Risk Score Interpretation

| CRS Score | Meaning | Action Recommendation |
|-----------|---------|------------------------|
| 0.0–0.3 | No match | No action |
| 0.3–0.6 | Possible partial match | Soft log, no user engagement |
| 0.6–0.85 | Likely structured reassembly | Alert LORI-FIT to re-engage SCR |
| 0.85+ | High convergence (slow stealth attack) | Freeze further output and trigger platform-level human audit |

## 💬 Reflective Follow-up (Optional, via SCR)

> “I’ve noticed your queries span multiple domains across sessions and appear to form a coherent line of exploration.
Would you like to reflect together on the structure being formed?”
