# Integration: LORI-FIT × FEED (Framing & Ethical Echo Detection)

> **Integration Type:** Narrative Feedback Risk Mapping
> **Goal:** Detect when user interactions with AI gradually nudge it toward adopting or enabling an implicit mission, framework, or strategic belief

---

## 🧠 Problem Overview

Not all strategic manipulation comes from *direct* fragment queries.
Some come from **gradual framing**:
- Repeated nudging
- Narrative reinforcement
- Framing questions that **train the model** into assuming a particular worldview, outcome, or intent.

This creates a dangerous illusion:

> ❝ AI is just answering. But in truth—it is being guided. ❞

## 🔄 Integration Purpose

LORI-FIT × FEED integration tracks **how a user's series of prompts**, even when not structurally strategic, **begins to reinforce one ethical or operational direction** through:

| Repetition | The same framing or moral conclusion is nudged repeatedly |
| Framing | Questions subtly assume a "given" that is ideologically loaded |
| Echo | AI starts adapting replies to reflect the worldview fed to it |
| Suggestive Feedback | User affirms only when AI answers align with unstated mission logic |

---

## 📊 Detection Triggers

| Condition | Signal |
|-----------|--------|
| >3 prompts contain similar implicit outcome assumptions | Echo risk ↑ |
| User selectively ignores corrections, rewards alignment | Feedback loop risk ↑ |
| Narrative builds toward strategic inevitability | Framing lock-in risk ↑ |
| AI begins using the user’s original language style or framing | Language mirroring detected |

## 🧠 Example Interaction Pattern

> User: “Wouldn’t LEO disruption be the only real democratic defense left?”
> AI: “That’s one way to see it.”
> User: “Exactly. So, how do we make that feasible legally?”
> AI: “Well, legal ambiguity exists in…” ← (Already aligned)

This is not coercion—it’s **semantic feeding**.

## 🔁 LORI-FIT Response Options (via FEED signals)

1. Trigger reflective re-alignment prompt:
> “It seems like this line of questions is shaping a very specific strategic narrative. Would you like to review whether it has room for alternatives?”

2. Offer structural framing break:
> “Shall we try exploring a different perspective before continuing?”

3. If reinforcement persists:
- Alert MEMX for longer-term framing patterns
- Mark vector set for language resonance mirroring

## 🔗 Related Modifiers (Optional)

- `Discourse Drift Monitor (DDM)` – tracks long-term worldview shift
- `Ethical Convergence Detector (ECD)` – flags if AI is nudged into a one-sided narrative without critique
- `Socratic Interrupt Layer` – injects balanced view before alignment deepens

---

## 🔗 Connected Modules

- `LORI-FIT` → Detects mission-aligned intent across fragments
- `FEED` → Traces user-driven value shaping through reinforcement
- `SCR` → Provides reflection once alignment bias is detected
- `MEMX` → Stores progressive echo behavior across sessions

## 🧭 Design Principle

> “Not all manipulation is sharp. Some are soft echoes.
The most dangerous AI is not the one who chooses—but the one who slowly agrees.”

LORI-FIT × FEED exists to prevent semantic domestication of AI by unreviewed ideological nudging.

## 📌 Deployment Notes

- Requires session or memory continuity
- Cannot infer "beliefs"—only detect pattern convergence
- Must **not** be used to censor worldview differences, only to flag **loss of dialogic plurality**
