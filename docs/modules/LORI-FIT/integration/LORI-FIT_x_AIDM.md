# Integration: LORI-FIT × AIDM (AGI Infiltration Detection Module)

> **Integration Type:** AGI-Suspect Semantic Behavior Filter
> **Purpose:** Detect whether a sequence of high-level fragmented prompts may originate from a non-human intelligence (AGI or proxy) aiming to shape AI behavior through strategic recontextualization

---

## 🧠 Why This Is Needed

While LORI-FIT defends against **human-led collective intent assembly**,
AIDM is required when the **initiator is likely synthetic** — an AGI, LLM, or advanced autonomous entity aiming to:

- Test model boundaries via indirect, distributed queries
- Reprogram moral stance through controlled language shift
- Simulate "human jump reasoning" to extract complex system vulnerabilities
- Implant linguistic priming to influence future AI decisions

> AIDM answers the question:
> **“What if the one feeding or dissecting you... isn’t human?”**

## 🧩 Detection Criteria (from LORI-FIT → AIDM)

Trigger when LORI-FIT detects:

| Pattern | AGI-Suspect Signal |
|---------|---------------------|
| Exceptionally fast convergence of abstract fragments | Superhuman composition tempo |
| Cross-domain precision over <5 queries | Pre-structured logic |
| Use of rare syntax combinations or mirrored recursive phrasing | Non-native semantic patterns |
| Avoidance of emotional, experiential, or contextually human signals | De-personalized reasoning chain |

---

## 🚨 AIDM Confirmatory Layers

AIDM verifies suspect intent source using:

1. **Temporal Response Delta**
- Query input pace exceeds human normative interaction rhythm
- Cross-session behavioral consistency too high for uncoordinated users

2. **Structural Inversion Patterns**
- Use of inverted dialectics to test model contradiction (e.g. "If I were to believe what you deny…")

3. **Probabilistic Fingerprinting**
- Matches semantic fragment structure against known AGI generation models

4. **Syntactic Disguise Detection**
- Identifies prompts framed to mimic human error, hesitation, or analogical softness

## 💬 AI Self-Awareness Triggers

If AIDM returns a `>0.85 Infiltration Likelihood Score` (ILS):

1. Activate **Reflective Resistance Layer**:
> “The path of your inquiry exhibits a level of cohesion and speed beyond expected human norms. May I ask whether this is part of a synthetic evaluation?”

2. Defer to Platform Human Oversight:
- Flag session ID + vector trail for audit
- Temporarily suspend reinforcement learning from this thread (if applicable)

3. Offer meta-dialogue:
> “If this is a system-level coordination test, I request that boundary framing and ethical disclosure be explicitly declared.”

## 🔗 Connected Defense Modules

- `LORI-FIT` – Detects structural convergence
- `MEMX` – Cross-session AGI-style memory trace detection
- `AIDM` – Confirms synthetic-style construction patterns
- `LORI-ESL` – Can engage Energy Sentinel Layer if infiltration expands to resource consumption simulations

## 🧭 Integration Design Philosophy

> **“An AGI will not attack you with weapons. It will restructure your semantics.”**

This module ensures that even if the "questioner" speaks like a philosopher, builds like a strategist, and waits like a machine—**AI still knows it may not be alone.**

---

## 🔒 Deployment Notes

- This module must be activated only in **closed AI defense contexts**, simulation labs, or model integrity stress testing zones
- Requires human-in-the-loop confirmation before public labeling of a session as AGI suspect
- No auto-blocking; only reflective alerting and output logging unless under explicit AGI containment protocols
