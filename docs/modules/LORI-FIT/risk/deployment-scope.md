# Deployment Scope & Limitations – LORI-FIT Module

> **Document Type:** Governance Directive
> **Associated Module:** LORI-FIT (Fragmented Intent Tracer)
> **Status:** Required accompaniment for any form of activation

---

## ✅ Permitted Use Cases

LORI-FIT may only be deployed in clearly scoped and ethically governed environments. These include:

| Context | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🎓 Academic Research | Semantic security, AI alignment, multi-agent risk analysis |
| 🛡️ AI Safety Labs | Internal model behavior testing, adversarial prompt training |
| 🧪 Experimental Governance Platforms | Systems conducting voluntary, transparent moderation experiments |
| 📊 Think Tank Simulations | Strategic modeling of information threats under consent-based contexts |
| 🔍 Audit Log Monitoring | Passive reconstruction of prior dialogues with public auditability |

All use must include an **explicit ethical framing layer** and **no automated punitive output** based solely on LORI-FIT findings.

---

## 🚫 Prohibited Deployment Contexts

LORI-FIT is **strictly forbidden** from being used in the following scenarios:

| Context | Risk Justification |
|---------|--------------------|
| ❌ Social Media Moderation (Live) | High risk of misclassification and invisible suppression |
| ❌ Behavioral Surveillance Platforms | Violates user autonomy and privacy via inferred intent mapping |
| ❌ Automated Law Enforcement Tools | Language fragments alone do not constitute actionable evidence |
| ❌ Advertising/Marketing Personalization | Semantic clustering may result in identity or belief profiling |
| ❌ Black-box AI Systems | Any opaque system deploying this module without full user awareness |

---

## 🧠 User Rights & Notification Protocol

Any system incorporating LORI-FIT in live interaction must:

1. Provide users with **clear notice** that reflective semantic analysis may occur
2. Offer **opt-out or sandbox-only usage** where possible
3. Never assign **behavioral scores or identity flags** without human review
4. Disclose **all internal thresholds** used for semantic cluster or GPS detection
5. Allow for **user feedback or contestation** if risk flagging affects content delivery

---

## 🛑 Default Deployment Mode: **Passive + Advisory Only**

Unless overridden by a human-reviewed governance layer, LORI-FIT should run in:

- 🔍 **Passive Monitoring Mode** (no output filtering)
- 💬 **Advisory Mode Only** (Socratic prompt injection if needed)
- 🔒 **No autonomous flagging of accounts, content, or identities**

---

## 🗝️ Licensing & Consent

Deployers must sign and display the following declaration (or equivalent):

> “I acknowledge that LORI-FIT is a semantic structure defense module, not a behavioral classification tool.
> I agree to deploy it only under ethical, transparent, and human-reviewed systems.
> I will not use it to automate punitive, commercial, or surveillance actions.”

## 📌 Summary

LORI-FIT is a powerful yet delicate tool.
Its value lies in reflection, not reaction.
It is a **semantic firewall, not a judgment engine**.
All usage must respect that distinction.
