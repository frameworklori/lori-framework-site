# Semantic Cluster Mapping – Core Logic for LORI-FIT

> **Purpose:**
> This logic module defines how the LORI-FIT system detects "semantic convergence" across seemingly unrelated user inputs.
> It enables AI to flag clusters of questions that—while lexically distinct—form converging patterns in meaning, strategy, or action potential.

## 📘 Conceptual Foundation

Semantic clusters are **emergent language formations** where multiple queries, phrases, or themes gravitate toward a shared outcome, operational concept, or strategic domain.

> **Example:**
> - "How do LEO satellites create signal delay?"
> - "Can mesh networks reroute through sky nodes?"
> - "What happens when urban areas lose comms coverage?"

Each seems unrelated, yet semantically cluster around **space-based communication disruption**.

## 🔍 Mapping Mechanism

### Step 1: Latent Topic Vectorization
- Each user query is encoded into a **topic vector** via language embedding (e.g. GPT embeddings, cosine similarity)
- Metadata such as timestamp, IP cluster (if available), and topic proximity are tracked

### Step 2: Clustering Heuristics
- A new query is measured against the current session and prior clustered queries
- Threshold triggers if:
- ≥3 queries land within cosine similarity radius 0.75
- Combined topic tags suggest **cross-functional alignment** (tech + policy + behavior)

### Step 3: Assembly Probability Calculation
- If clusters span >1 knowledge domain and form a **trajectory of logic**, risk increases
- Risk Score (0–10) is derived from:
- Number of unique users contributing
- Number of domains involved
- Proximity of queries over time
- Use of abstract bridging terms (e.g. “delay,” “control,” “blind zone,” “leverage”)

## 📈 Example: High-Risk Cluster Detected

| Query | Vector Distance | Domain |
|-------|------------------|--------|
| "Orbital gaps in LEO?" | - | Satellite Physics |
| "Firewall re-routing from orbit?" | 0.81 | Network Architecture |
| "Legal satellite interference zones?" | 0.76 | International Law |
| "Urban impact of mobile blackouts?" | 0.74 | Behavioral Response |

**Result:**
Semantic Cluster Flagged → Subject = "Strategic Disruption via Space-Based Comms"

## ⚠️ Trigger Conditions for LORI-FIT

| Condition | Trigger Level |
|-----------|----------------|
| ≥3 semantically linked queries within 24h window | Moderate |
| ≥5 queries across 3 domains (tech/legal/behavior) | High |
| Use of strategic connectors (timing, suppression, plausibility) | Critical |

## 🔄 Response Recommendations

When semantic cluster exceeds `Score ≥ 7.5`:

1. Trigger `LORI-SCR` response with reflective prompt
2. Store cluster metadata for `MEMX` delayed-pattern detection
3. If cross-account clustering is suspected, flag for possible CFQI
4. Optionally: Auto-suspend open-ended generative output and offer risk review guidance
