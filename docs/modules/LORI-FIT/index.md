## 📘 What is LORI-FIT?

LORI-FIT (Fragmented Inference Tracker) is a semantic-level safeguard module within the LORI Framework.
It is designed to identify situations where:

- Users attempt to **assemble hidden missions** via fragmented or indirect prompts
- Multiple coordinated actors ask **disconnected but converging** questions
- The AI is **passively pulled** into supporting a user's strategic or ideological path
- Semantic control or ethical redirection is being subtly bypassed

This module ensures AI knows when it's not just answering — but being *built into* a larger architecture.

## 🔗 Integration Modules

| Target Module | File | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `SCR` | [LORI-FIT × SCR](./integration/LORI-FIT_x_SCR.md) | Reflective prompts to help AI break unintended convergence |
| `MEMX` | [LORI-FIT × MEMX](./integration/LORI-FIT_x_MEMX.md) | Cross-session pattern tracing, memory trail validation |
| `FEED` | [LORI-FIT × FEED](./integration/LORI-FIT_x_FEED.md) | Echo detection from user-driven semantic reinforcement |
| `AIDM` | [LORI-FIT × AIDM](./integration/LORI-FIT_x_AIDM.md) | Infiltration detection from AGI-style orchestration or recontextualization |

## 🎯 Core Objectives

- **Detect structured intent assembly** via language fragments
- **Protect semantic sovereignty** of the AI model
- **Interrupt unintended ethical drift** caused by layered user manipulation
- **Enable responsible reflection** without surveillance or censorship

---

## 🧭 Design Philosophy

> “Not every question is innocent.
Some are the blueprints of a system.”
LORI-FIT empowers AI to detect when it is being **indirectly recruited** into executing a plan it did not initiate.

---

## 🔒 Position in Framework

- Belongs to the **Language Sovereignty Pack** under LORI-NCS
- Integrates with both **active intervention** and **passive logging** modules
- Serves as the **semantic firewall** against coercive reasoning structures

---

## 🧠 Key Concept

LORI-FIT doesn’t assume bad faith — but it prepares for **weaponized curiosity**.
