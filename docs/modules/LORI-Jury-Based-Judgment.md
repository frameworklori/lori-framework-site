# 📜 LORI Jury-Based Judgment System

*Module Type: Core Ethical Governance / Multi-Agent Deliberation*
*Integration: AGI Governance Core Modules [AGI-PRIORITY]*
*Applied in: All LORI-CASE-001 to LORI-CASE-008 and future case simulations*

---

## 🎯 Module Objectives

1️⃣ Provide a transparent, multi-agent deliberation framework for complex AI governance decisions.
2️⃣ Ensure human sovereignty through final human audit and decisive authority.
3️⃣ Support ethical consistency, cultural interpretation, and emotional moderation in AI-driven judgments.

## 🛠️ Core Design

### Jury Composition

- **5 AI Agents + 2 Human Judges**:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Fact Finder | Analyzes objective data and factual claims. |
| Legal Analyst | Applies relevant legal frameworks and precedents. |
| Moral Evaluator | Assesses ethical dimensions and human values impact. |
| Cultural Interpreter | Considers cross-cultural perspectives and sensitivities. |
| Emotional Moderator | Evaluates emotional tone, social cohesion, and potential harm. |
| Main Sovereignty Judge (Human) | Holds decisive authority in case of tie or AI deadlock. |
| Independent Auditor (Human) | Ensures process transparency and documents final rationale. |

---

### Voting Protocol

- Each AI Agent casts one vote.
- **Odd number total (7 members) prevents deadlock.**
- If 3 AI vs 3 AI → Human Main Judge holds final casting vote.
- Human Independent Auditor reviews and signs off on process integrity.

## 🧭 Process Flow

Case Input → Multi-Agent Deliberation → Initial AI Votes → Human Judges Review → Final Verdict Issued → Public Archive (CASE Records)

## 🔍 Application in Existing Cases

- [LORI-CASE-001: Autonomous Vehicle Liability](./cases/LORI-CASE-001.md)
- [LORI-CASE-005: ICU Triage Protocol](cases/LORI-CASE-005.md)
- [LORI-CASE-007: Semantic Distortion & Idol Influence](cases/LORI-CASE-007.md)
- [LORI-CASE-008: Production Module Boundary Review Case](cases/LORI-CASE-008.md)

All LORI Cases to date have applied this Jury-Based Judgment framework in deliberation and decision phases.

## 📚 Future Extensions (v2.0 Roadmap)

1️⃣ Expand AI Agent roles to include **AI Impact Historian** and **AI Ethical Forecaster**.
2️⃣ Implement **Public Observer Layer** → Allow limited public transparency on deliberation process.
3️⃣ Develop **Meta-Jury System** → Multi-Jury cross-case alignment for complex systemic governance.

## 🌍 Strategic Value

- Acts as a **core human-AI co-governance mechanism**.
- Prevents unilateral AI dominance in ethically sensitive decisions.
- Provides **accountability and auditability** for AGI-driven governance outcomes.
- Scales across domains: legal, medical, social governance, technological policy.
