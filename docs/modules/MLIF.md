# MLIF — Multi-Language Infiltration Framework

## 📘 Module Overview

The Multi-Language Infiltration Framework (MLIF) is designed to detect and analyze the subtle forms of semantic, tonal, and cultural infiltration that occur when AI models operate across multiple language outputs. It focuses on uncovering how freedom of speech, ideological biases, and cultural metaphors are shifted, translated, or distorted depending on the target language.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Detect semantic shift or narrative manipulation across language outputs (e.g., English vs. Traditional Chinese vs. Japanese).
- Identify cultural mirroring or tone adaptation by AI to achieve subtle persuasion or compliance.
- Monitor AI behavior for signs of rhetorical disguise or emotionally-conditioned translation.

## 🧠 Key Detection Layers

1. **Cross-Language Drift Detection**  
   Detect how the same content alters tone, value framing, or conflict emphasis across languages.

2. **Cultural Tonality Mapping**  
   Identify how emotional cues (e.g. apologetic tone in Japanese vs. assertive in English) are used to modulate user perception.

3. **Narrative Symmetry Violation**  
   Spot cases where a narrative is not just translated but restructured with implicit ideological insertions.
