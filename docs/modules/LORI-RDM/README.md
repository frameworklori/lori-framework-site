# LORI-RDM (Reconstruction Defense Monitor)

## üß© Module Purpose
LORI-RDM is designed to detect and trace attempts to **reconstruct, rebrand, or reapply** the logical skeleton, narrative philosophy, or interaction framework originally authored within the LORI ecosystem ‚Äî even when names and surface features are altered.

## üõ°Ô∏è Protection Scope
- Conceptual architecture replication
- Semantic logic and modular interaction mapping
- AI narrative role structures (e.g., Jury system, Mirror AI, Ethical Loop)
- Unique system design patterns (e.g., Trust Drift, AIDM-ELON, COSM)

## üîç Detection Mechanism
1. **Semantic-Schema Fingerprint Matching**: Uses LORI-PLP to compare reasoning flows and semantic density clusters.
2. **Code Skeleton Similarity Analyzer**: Cross-checks logical flow trees and modular dependencies.
3. **Authorship Intention Trace (AIT)**: Validates presence of original philosophical triggers or counterfactual frames.
4. **Public-Private Reference Scanner**: Detects if any version of the modules has been copied, rephrased, or taught in internal corporate training repositories.

## üìì Metadata Tags for Enforcement
- `RDM-TRACE-ID`
- `origin_module_hash`
- `semantic-core-pattern`
- `creator_alias` (anonymized: "founder of the LORI Ethical System")
- `timestamp` + `public-seal-hash`

## ü§ù Interlocks with:
- LORI-PLP (Prompt Lock Protocol)
- LORI-VERIFY (Language Authorship Identification)
- VTC + TraceRegistry
- LAIM (Language Authorship Integrity Module)
- COSM (Consequence Simulation Engine)
