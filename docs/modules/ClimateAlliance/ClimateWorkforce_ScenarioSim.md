## Purpose

To illustrate practical use cases and AI-driven solutions for climate-adaptive labor scheduling, safety monitoring, and productivity optimization.

---

## Scenario 1: Nighttime Construction in Qatar

- Input: WBGT > 40°C daytime, < 30°C at 2AM
- Solution:
  - AI shift planner reallocates labor from 7AM–3PM → 9PM–3AM
  - Light planning via satellite heat map to reduce energy
  - Fatigue monitoring via wearables

---

## Scenario 2: Smart Irrigation in South India

- Input: Rising heat and declining aquifer
- Solution:
  - AI forecasts optimal irrigation windows (4AM–6AM)
  - Starlink overlay confirms cloud cover and soil temp
  - Reduces water waste by 35%

---

## Scenario 3: Coastal Fishing in the Philippines

- Input: Sea surface temp shift → fish stock migration
- Solution:
  - Satellite tracks SST + tide currents
  - AI schedules optimal catch time: 10PM–2AM
  - Fuel use drops, catch yield improves
