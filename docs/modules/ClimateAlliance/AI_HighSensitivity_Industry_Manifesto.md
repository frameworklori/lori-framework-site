# AI × High-Sensitivity Climate Industry Alliance Manifesto

**Version:** v1.0  
**Authoring Entity:** LORI Ethical System  
**Date:** July 7, 2025

---

## 1. Preamble

As the global climate crisis accelerates, frontline industries such as agriculture, livestock, fisheries, water resources, and construction are suffering disproportionate impacts. These sectors form the backbone of food security, infrastructure, and ecological balance, yet their workers are the least protected from extreme heat, drought, marine disruption, and resource scarcity.

This manifesto calls for the formation of an AI-powered, satellite-enabled international alliance to defend the rights, livelihoods, and adaptive capacity of labor-intensive, climate-sensitive industries. It promotes collaborative, data-driven, justice-centered solutions.

## 2. Alliance Goals

- Establish a cross-industry and cross-border **Climate-Sensitive Sector Resilience Alliance (CSSRA)**
- Develop AI + satellite–based early warning, labor safety, and smart scheduling systems
- Promote adaptive public policies and heat-resilient legal frameworks
- Launch the **Global Heat Labor Index (GHLI)** for ethical risk quantification
- Support region-specific pilot programs with international observability

## 3. Target Industries and Sensitivity Matrix

| Sector         | Climate Risk Impact               | Sensitivity Index | Workforce Scope | Urgency of Resilience |
|----------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Agriculture     | Heatwaves, drought, flooding      | ★★★★★            | Extremely high   | Critical               |
| Livestock       | Heat stress, water scarcity       | ★★★★☆            | High             | High                   |
| Fisheries       | Ocean warming, acidification      | ★★★★★            | Moderate–High    | Critical               |
| Water Resources | Depletion, pollution, conflict    | ★★★★☆            | High             | High                   |
| Construction    | Heatstroke, unworkable conditions | ★★★★★            | High             | Critical               |

## 4. Technology Integration Plan

- **Starlink + AI Fusion**:
  - Real-time WBGT monitoring
  - Ocean and soil condition imaging
  - Smart scheduling via AI shift optimization

- **Mobile & IoT Coordination**:
  - Worker wearables linked to heat alert systems
  - On-site cooling zone recommendations
  - Predictive weather scheduling dashboards

- **GHLI Dashboard**:
  - Regional heat-labor vulnerability index with satellite + demographic data
  - Public visibility and government use via open API

---

## 5. Policy & Insurance Proposals

- Enforce **WBGT-based labor stop thresholds** (>30°C WBGT for heavy work)
- Legalize and incentivize **nighttime construction zones**
- Government-funded **heat illness micro-insurance** for daily laborers
- Mandate **water access equity** using satellite-monitored distribution
- Expand **livestock & crop insurance** with Starlink-triggered heat loss claims

## 6. Pilot Region Strategy

| Country / Region  | Focus Sector     | Initial Action                         |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| India (South)     | Agriculture       | Dawn shift trials + AI irrigation sync |
| Philippines       | Fisheries         | Night fishing navigation with Starlink |
| Qatar / Japan     | Construction      | Night work scheduling and cooling test |
| Kenya             | Water resources   | Conflict zone mapping + early alert    |
| Taiwan            | Multi-sector      | GHLI-driven smart scheduling pilot     |

---

## 7. Call for Co-Creation

We invite the following stakeholders to co-develop, co-govern, and co-implement this initiative:

- 🌾 Agricultural & fisheries cooperatives (FAO, ILO affiliates)
- 🛰️ Satellite and connectivity partners (xAI, Starlink, OneWeb)
- 🏗️ Engineering and construction firms in heat-exposed zones
- 💧 Environmental & water governance organizations
- ⚖️ Insurance innovators and labor rights NGOs
- 🧠 AI research groups aligned with ethical frameworks like LORI
