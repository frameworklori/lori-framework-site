## 1. Purpose

The Global Heat Labor Index (GHLI) is a composite indicator designed to quantify and compare heat-related labor risks across industries and regions. It supports ethical climate adaptation governance, smart scheduling, and insurance calibration for vulnerable workforce sectors.

## 2. Index Components

| Component               | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Heat Risk Score         | Based on Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), humidity, UV index, and duration of exposure |
| Labor Vulnerability     | Includes worker age, income, migrant status, labor intensity, and safety access |
| Adaptation Readiness    | Measures availability of cooling systems, hydration stations, night shift policy, and insurance access |
| Justice Priority Index  | Drawn from the ECJ (Environmental Climate Justice) module: weights regions with historical injustice or marginalized labor |

---

## 3. Data Sources

- **Starlink satellite imagery** for surface temperature, marine temperature, and resource distribution
- **IoT wearables** for real-time WBGT + worker health telemetry
- **Local labor registries** and census demographics
- **RIM and ECJ module outputs** for ethical calibration

## 4. GHLI Scoring Scale

| GHLI Score Range | Risk Level         | Recommendation                          |
|------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 80–100           | Critical           | Mandatory work stoppage or full night shift adaptation |
| 60–79            | High               | Enforced smart scheduling with AI override |
| 40–59            | Moderate           | Increased breaks, hydration and early shift conversion |
| 0–39             | Low                | Continue with standard safety protocols |

---

## 5. Implementation

- GHLI dashboards to be deployed per region via public portal
- Integration with labor protection policies and insurance systems
- Supported by Starlink–AI backend for live updates
- LORI Jury may review use cases for priority intervention zones
