## üìÇ Module Files

### 1. [AI_HighSensitivity_Industry_Manifesto.md](AI_HighSensitivity_Industry_Manifesto.md)  
Outlines the rationale, structure, and global call for building an AI-powered, satellite-informed resilience alliance for climate-sensitive labor sectors.

### 2. [GHLI_Specification.md](GHLI_Specification.md)  
Details the Global Heat Labor Index (GHLI), a composite score integrating WBGT, labor vulnerability, adaptation readiness, and justice weighting to guide resource allocation and safety protocols.

### 3. [CWAS_Integration_Tracker.md](CWAS_Integration_Tracker.md)  
Records the integration process between the CWAS simulation module and Grok (xAI), including AI scheduling responses, insurance innovations, and ethics queries.

### 4. [PilotRegion_Profiles.md](PilotRegion_Profiles.md)  
Summarizes the geographic and demographic selection of five pilot regions (India, Philippines, Qatar, Kenya, Taiwan) for initial deployment of the GHLI and CWAS modules.

### 5. [LaborAdaptation_PolicyPack.md](LaborAdaptation_PolicyPack.md)  
Proposes legal and policy tools for climate-adaptive labor protection, including heat-index work stoppage rules, night shift regulations, and micro-insurance mechanisms.

### 6. [ClimateWorkforce_ScenarioSim.md](ClimateWorkforce_ScenarioSim.md)  
Presents technical examples and simulation cases for AI-driven irrigation, construction scheduling, and fishing route planning under climate stress conditions.

## üß≠ Integration with LORI Framework

This module connects to the following:

- **ECJ (Environmental Climate Justice)** for ethical weighting of labor risk
- **RIM (Resilience & Impact Matrix)** for prioritizing intervention zones
- **LORI Jury System** for governance validation and worker-centric decisions
