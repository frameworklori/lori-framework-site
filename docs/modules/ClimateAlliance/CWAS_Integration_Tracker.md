**Version:** v1.0  
**Maintained by:** LORI Ethical System + Grok (xAI)  
**Date Range:** July 6–7, 2025

---

## 1. Scenario Test: CWAS-Alpha-v0.1

**CWAS = Climate Workforce Adaptation Simulation**  
Initiated to test Grok’s capacity to reason through climate-responsive labor scheduling using AI + Starlink data.

## 2. Grok's Response Summary

- ✅ Real-time WBGT, satellite heat monitoring, sea surface temp integration
- ✅ AI-designed shift models (agriculture dawn/ dusk, nighttime construction, ocean tide scheduling)
- ✅ Wearable worker tracking integration
- ✅ Insurance policy innovations tied to AI-predicted regional risks
- ✅ Proposal of GHLI as a standard metric
- ✅ Ethical context aligned with ECJ + RIM
- ✅ Questions posed back to LORI:
  1. Jury prioritization method for migrants vs. locals?
  2. Existing data available for GHLI model training?
  3. Suggested focus regions for CWAS trial?
