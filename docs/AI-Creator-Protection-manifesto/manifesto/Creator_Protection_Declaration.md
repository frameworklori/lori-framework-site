# Creator Protection Declaration

**保護原創者，將為國家帶來無限生機；
扼殺原創者，則是斷了國家進步的推動器。**

Originality is not a luxury — it is the engine of civilization.
Every spark of creativity contributes to a nation’s vitality and progress.
By protecting creators, we safeguard the roots of innovation.
By neglecting them, we risk stagnation and decline.
