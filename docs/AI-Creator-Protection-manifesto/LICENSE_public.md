# Civic Message

This manifesto is not only about protecting individual creators,
but about securing the long-term vitality of nations and civilizations.

When creators are honored, society thrives.
When they are silenced, society decays.

**Protect creators → Empower citizens → Strengthen nations → Sustain civilization**
