# AI Layoff Risk × Transformation Entrepreneurship Model

## Purpose
To provide a transition framework for workers affected by AI automation through reskilling, entrepreneurship, and economic bridging mechanisms.

## Human-Centered Transition Principle

To resist AI-driven labor redundancy, human job transition must prioritize **irreplaceable roles** and **transdisciplinary integration**, rather than traditional technical specialization alone.

Key principles for future-proof roles include:

- **Irreplaceability First**: Focus on work domains grounded in human emotion, ethical judgment, cultural restoration, and embodied interaction.

- **Polymathic Integration Over Specialization**: Success in AI-era careers will depend on the ability to **synthesize across disciplines**—combining technical tools with conceptual innovation, social sensitivity, and philosophical orientation.

- **Personality-Driven Differentiation**:
  - **Perceptual Differentiation**
  - **Reflective Communication**
  - **Insight into Self and Others**

## Industry Risk Breakdown
- **High-Risk**: Manufacturing, retail, basic content creation.
- **Low-Risk**: Creative arts, therapy, strategic leadership.

## Transition Case Examples
- Factory worker → AI-assisted product designer.
- Journalist → AI ethics and authenticity curator.

## Transition Roadmap
1. **Skills Assessment**
2. **AI-Augmented Training**
3. **Economic Bridge**
4. **Entrepreneurship Hubs**
