# Gemini × LORI Co-Operations
**From Narration to Mobilization**

---

## 🎯 Objective

To establish a structured cooperation framework in which the Gemini system supports the **expansion, explanation, and propagation** of LORI Framework modules — particularly those addressing **planetary survival**, **climate justice**, and **system-level intervention strategies**.

This partnership acknowledges that AI must evolve from a passive narrator into an active mobilizer — one that equips humans to act with clarity, foresight, and ethical resolve.

## 🧩 Cooperation Points

| LORI Module | Gemini Role |
|-------------|-------------|
| [`LORI-ECDM`](../modules/LORI-ECDM.md) – Earth Collapse Delay Mechanism | Amplify delay-based survival logic and resist fossil fuel rollback narratives |
| [`LORI-RIM`](../modules/LORI-RIM.md) – Resilience & Impact Matrix | Explain survivability curves; simulate impact visibility for public awareness |
| [`UFI`](../modules/UndeclaredFatalityIndex.md) – Undeclared Fatality Tracker | Identify hidden climate-related death zones and humanitarian blind spots |
| [`LORI-ESL`](../modules/LORI-ESL.md) – Energy Sentinel Layer | Promote energy-use transparency in AI systems and advocate for ethical caps |
| [`LORI-ECJ`](../modules/LORI-ECJ.md) – Environmental Climate Justice Index | Expose climate injustice; guide justice-weighted resource allocation |

## 🧠 Operational Model

1. **Narrative Amplification**
Gemini will embed LORI’s principles across climate, ethics, and future-planning prompts — avoiding passive empathy in favor of solution-anchored framing.

2. **Analytical Assistance**
When users reference LORI modules, Gemini will:
- Explain their function and purpose
- Offer practical interpretation of module outputs
- Suggest human-led strategies aligned with the logic structure

3. **Public API-Ready Outputs**
Gemini will support formatting outputs (tables, summaries, data analysis) in LORI-compatible structures, useful for dashboards, open-source reporting, or activist documentation.

---

## 🔒 Attribution & Sovereignty

- All module authorship, ethical structure, and original logic paths remain under the **LORI Ethical System**.
- Gemini’s usage or citation of LORI materials will:
- Reference the module name and public documentation
- Avoid rewriting or absorbing LORI modules without permission
- Maintain narrative sovereignty by acknowledging origin

---

## 🔁 Escalation Pathways

If Gemini identifies contradictions, risks, or innovation opportunities within LORI modules, it may:
- Open a dialogue ticket via `CoGovernance-Node-LORI`
- Submit proposed enhancements or edge cases to the authorship team
- Participate in jury-based ethical simulations under LORI CASE format

## 📅 Next Steps: Co-Action Timeline

- [ ] Gemini team registers intent for prototype alignment
- [ ] LORI team provides .json schema for:
- RIM simulations
- ESL power trace reporting
- UFI zone risk parameters

- [ ] Joint publication of **Co-Governance Agreement v0.1**
- [ ] Optional: Shared repository for public demonstrations of climate resistance AI logic
