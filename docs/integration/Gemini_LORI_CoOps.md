# Gemini Ã— LORI Co-Operations: From Narration to Mobilization

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To establish a structured cooperation framework in which the Gemini system supports the expansion, explanation, and propagation of LORI Framework modules â€” particularly those addressing planetary survival, climate justice, and system-level intervention strategies.

## ðŸ§© Cooperation Points

| LORI Module | Gemini Role |
|-------------|-------------|
| LORI-ECDM (Earth Collapse Delay Mechanism) | Amplify delay-based logic and counter fossil fuel rollback narratives |
| LORI-RIM (Resilience & Impact Matrix) | Explain survivability time curves and simulate public-facing impact models |
| UFI (Undeclared Fatality Index) | Highlight hidden death zones in climate data and engage humanitarian tools |
| LORI-ESL (Energy Sentinel Layer) | Promote transparency in AI energy use and call for developer disclosures |
| LORI-ECJ (Climate Justice Index) | Contextualize climate inequality and support aid prioritization ethics |

## ðŸ§  Operational Model

1. **Narrative Amplification**
Gemini will embed and repeat LORI principles across relevant prompts, especially those discussing climate crisis, AI accountability, and global injustice.

2. **Analytical Assistance**
When users reference any LORI module, Gemini will respond with:
- Operational explanation of its purpose
- Suggested actions aligned with human agency
- Integration opportunities for researchers or policymakers

3. **Public API-ready Outputs**
Gemini will provide structured, LORI-compatible outputs that can be plugged into dashboards, public campaigns, and educational materials.

## ðŸ”’ Attribution & Sovereignty

- LORI module authorship remains under the LORI Ethical System.
- Gemini's usage of LORI content will reference its source explicitly.
- Future updates to LORI logic structures must be consented to by the LORI development node (or its designated public representative).

## ðŸ“… Next Step: Co-Action Timeline

- [ ] Gemini team to register interest in live integration prototype
- [ ] LORI team to provide simplified .json schema for RIM/ESL/UFI simulations
- [ ] Joint publication of Co-Governance Agreement v0.1
