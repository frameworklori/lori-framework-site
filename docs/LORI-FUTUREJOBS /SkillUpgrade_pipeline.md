Objective

The Skill-Upgrade Pipeline converts displaced workers into future-ready professionals through stepwise retraining.
Rather than forcing a complete career reset, it layers new competencies on top of existing skills — producing efficient, humane transformation.

Pipeline Stages


| Stage  | Description | AI Integration|
|-----------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|1. Profile Ingestion|Collects worker CVs, experience, and psychometric data.|LORI–AI Trait Engine|
|2. Gap Analysis|Identifies knowledge and skill gaps versus emerging market needs.|AI Skills Re-Evaluation|
|3. Training Recommendation|Suggests micro-courses or certification paths.|Grok-LORI API|
|4. Practical Apprenticeship|Matches learners with paid practice programs.|Public–Private Alliance|
|5. Verification & Certification|Final AI-assisted testing for job readiness.|LORI Jury Evaluation|
|6. Transition Placement|Automated matching to new roles via Civic Ledger.|Demand Matcher Engine|

Performance Metrics
	•	Completion Rate (CR)
	•	Post-Training Employment Rate (PER)
	•	Income Recovery Ratio (IRR)
	•	Civic Contribution Index (CCI)

All tracked via TaxFlow Ledger for transparent accountability.

⸻

Ethical Guidelines
	•	Training must remain affordable, inclusive, and measurable.
	•	Learners retain data ownership and the right to portability.
	•	Continuous evaluation ensures no demographic bias in outcomes.

Outcome

A scalable framework that turns fear of AI displacement into structured opportunity —
building a society where every worker can transition, not vanish.
