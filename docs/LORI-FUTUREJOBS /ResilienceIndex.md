Concept

The Resilience Index quantifies how resistant different occupations are to automation and economic shocks.
It offers a transparent score that helps governments, companies, and individuals identify which jobs can adapt, which need intervention, and which can evolve into hybrid human–AI roles.

Index Formula

R = (H x 0.4 ) +(A x 0.3) + (S X 0.2) + (E x 0.1)


| Variable  | Definition | 
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| H |Human-Facing Intensity (communication, empathy, creativity)|
| A |Adaptability Rate (how easily the role can absorb new tools)|
| S |Skill Transfer Potential (Cross-industry mobility)|
| E |Economic Necessity (socio-economic dependency factor)|

Scores range from 0–100.
	•	80–100 → Highly resilient
	•	50–79 → Moderate (requires periodic re-training)
	•	0–49 → Vulnerable (target for intervention)

Data Inputs
	•	Bureau of Labor Statistics datasets
	•	AI task-automation probability models
	•	LORI SkillUpgrade Pipeline outputs
	•	Civic feedback from regional employment boards

⸻

Applications
	•	Policy Planning: Prioritize subsidies for at-risk occupations.
	•	Corporate HR: Plan ethical automation transitions.
	•	Education Systems: Design adaptive curricula aligned with resilience scores.

Ethical Intent

“Measurement should not punish vulnerability, but guide collective protection.”

The Index serves as an ethical compass — directing policy toward stability, not austerity.
