# Socioeconomic Equilibrium Module
**Part of:** LORI-FUTUREJOBS System  
**Objective:** To balance the disparity between overpopulated low-education segments and underutilized skilled labor by establishing cross-border, ethical workforce redistribution.

## Key Ideas
- Welfare dependency must be replaced by capability participation.
- Educated citizens can export labor ethically via global cooperation.
- Cross-nation deployment alleviates domestic inflation pressure.
- Partner nations (e.g., Japan, Korea, EU) benefit from cultural & linguistic support.

## Example
A mid-level American technician trains in renewable energy systems and assists local projects in Japan’s rural areas, earning income while contributing to global sustainability.
