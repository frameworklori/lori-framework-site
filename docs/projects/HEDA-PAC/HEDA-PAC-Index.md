# HEDA-PAC
**Population × AI × Civilization Stability Module**
_A Sub-Framework of the LORI Framework_

---

## Overview

The **HEDA-PAC** module explores how advanced AI systems interact with human population dynamics, migration policies, labor structures, and civilization stability, particularly under conditions of:

- Declining birth rates
- Accelerating technological substitution
- Shifting cultural integration pressures

The goal is to design **balanced governance frameworks** that optimize population quality and integration, while preserving **social cohesion** and **long-term civilization resilience**.

**Reflective Question:**
_As humanity faces the prospect of becoming a rare species, can we overcome our own biases and choose to embrace cultural fusion — or will we allow those biases to drive us toward extinction?_
