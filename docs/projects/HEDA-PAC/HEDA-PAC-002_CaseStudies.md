## HEDA-PAC-CASE-001
**Japan's Aging Society & AI + Robot Substitution**

### Scenario
Japan faces rapid population aging with a shrinking workforce.
AI-driven robotics are increasingly proposed to supplement labor gaps, especially in healthcare, elder care, and service industries.

### Key Governance Questions
1️⃣ How to balance robotics adoption with human dignity and employment needs?

2️⃣ Will robot labor lead to greater isolation of the elderly population?

3️⃣ How to design intergenerational hybrid workforces?

4️⃣ How to ensure energy sustainability of large-scale robotics deployment?
