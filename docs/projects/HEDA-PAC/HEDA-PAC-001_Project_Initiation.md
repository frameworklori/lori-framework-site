# HEDA-PAC-001: Japan Aging Population & Robotics

## Scenario
Japan faces rapid population aging with shrinking workforce.
AI-driven robotics increasingly proposed to supplement labor gaps.

## Key Governance Questions
- How to balance robotics adoption with human dignity and employment needs?
- What are the risks of over-reliance on robotic labor?
- How to ensure cultural stability in an AI-augmented aging society?

## Module Interactions
- DGP: Monitors demographic pressures
- RBL: Limits on robotics penetration
- GHI: Hybrid adaptation intelligence (human-machine cooperation strategies)
- ESL: Monitoring AI & robotic energy usage sustainability

## Sensitivity Level
Level 1-2: Suitable for public policy discourse

## Recommended Governance Actions
- Establish robotics deployment guidelines aligned with demographic realities
- Protect elder care dignity with human oversight
- Promote intergenerational hybrid workforces
