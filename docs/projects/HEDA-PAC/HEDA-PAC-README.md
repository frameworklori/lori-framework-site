# HEDA-PAC Module
**Human-Environment-Demographic-AI: Population-AI-Civilization Module**

## Purpose
The HEDA-PAC module explores the intersection of AI governance with global demographic pressures, labor adaptation, migration policies, and civilization resilience strategies.

## Core Focus Areas
- Population decline and labor market shifts
- AI-driven automation and human-machine substitution balance
- Migration policy adaptation
- Cultural and political stability impacts

## Module Cases
| Case ID | Title | Focus Area |
|---------|-------|------------|
| HEDA-PAC-001 | Japan Aging Population & Robotics | National labor substitution |
| HEDA-PAC-002 | EU Migration Integration under Demographic Decline | International policy modeling |
| HEDA-PAC-003 | US Robotics & Service Labor Replacement | Labor & cultural stability |
| HEDA-PAC-004 | TBD (e.g. Korea, Taiwan, or Global AI-driven Resilience) | Civilization-scale resilience |

## Governance Sensitivity Level
- Initial cases: Public academic level (Level 1-2)
- Sensitive regional cases: Level 3 with caution in political framing

## Positioning within Lori Framework
- Links directly with:
→ DGP (Demographic Pressure)
→ GHI (Hybrid Adaptation Intelligence)
→ RBL (Robot-Based Labor Governance)
→ RSS (Reproductive Strategy Simulation)
→ ESL (Energy Sentinel Layer)
→ ODRAF (Outcome-Driven Risk Anticipation Framework)
