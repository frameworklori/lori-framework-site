# HEDA-PAC-001: Japan Aging Population & Robotics

## HEDA-PAC-CASE-004
**Korea Ultra-Low Birthrate & AI-driven Social Resilience**

### Scenario
South Korea has the world’s lowest birthrate.
Extreme academic and work pressures discourage marriage and childbearing.
AI and robotics are rapidly being adopted to supplement shrinking human resources.
Cultural resistance to immigration limits population supplementation options.
The government is beginning to explore AI-driven social resilience strategies.

### Key Governance Questions
1️⃣ Should AI be positioned as a civilizational resilience tool amid demographic collapse?
2️⃣ How to balance AI supplementation with rebuilding natural birth and family values?
3️⃣ Can Korea’s experience offer transferable models for other ultra-low birthrate societies?
4️⃣ How might robot labor and AI-driven narratives impact societal mental health and cultural dynamics?
