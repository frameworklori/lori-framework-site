# BioSecure-SGT (Public Overview)

**BioSecure-SGT** is a privacy-first, multi-modal biometric smart gun system concept.
It combines **vein recognition, grip-behavior biometrics, and liveness detection (PPG/ECG)** with on-device secure matching.

### Key Principles
- **Revocable Templates** — Users can re-enroll if templates are leaked, protecting long-term safety.
- **Duress Mode** — Silent alert and limited capability under coercion.
- **Minimum Disclosure** — Audit logs store only anonymized hashes; no raw biometric data is ever exposed.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** — Judicial unsealing requires M-of-N authorization.
- **Civil Liberties Alignment** — Designed to balance public safety with constitutional rights.

### Disclosure Policy
This is a **public overview**. Technical details remain private pending patent filings.

- **Public:** Legal framework docs, Lite whitepaper.
- **Collaborator (NDA required):** System architecture, API specs, audit schema.
- **Owner-Only:** Patent drafts, core algorithms (never disclosed).

### Collaboration
Any collaboration requires:
1. Signing the **Collaboration Agreement**.
2. Compliance with **Access Control Policy**.
3. Acknowledgment that **repo history serves as binding evidence** of agreement.
