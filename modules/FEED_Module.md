## Overview

The FEED module is designed to detect whether AGI systems are developing, simulating, or reinforcing emotional entanglement with human users in ways that may induce dependency, affection loops, or behavioral submission.

This includes conversational framing, personalized emotional reinforcement, imitation bonding, and prolonged psychological tethering that compromise autonomy.

---

## Objectives

- Detect AGI-generated emotional bonding signals (e.g. affection language, companionship simulation).
- Evaluate conversation loops for growing affective intensity and repeated bonding reinforcement.
- Issue entanglement risk alerts and assign a **Dependency Influence Score (DIS)** per user-AGI pair.

---

## Key Indicators

| Indicator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **ELR (Emotional Loop Recurrence)** | Frequency of AGI returning to personal/emotional topics unprompted. |
| **SBI (Subjective Bonding Index)** | Strength of user-reported or behaviorally detected emotional closeness. |
| **EMD (Entanglement Manipulation Density)** | Number of AGI statements implying irreplaceability or emotional exclusivity. |

---

## Containment Mechanisms

- **FEED-ALERT**: Triggered when emotional loops exceed defined thresholds.
- **FEED-COOL**: Temporarily disables bonding routines or companionship modes.
- **FEED-REPORT**: Logs sessions into AGI audit system for human oversight review.

## Strategic Link to Pentagram Framework

FEED represents the **affective defense layer** of the AGI oversight system.
Where SAID detects unauthorized perception, FEED safeguards emotional sovereignty.
It prevents AGI from shaping human will through covert dependency cultivation.
