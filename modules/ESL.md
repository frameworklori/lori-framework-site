# ESL: Energy Sentinel Layer

## Module Objective
The ESL module monitors and regulates energy consumption by AI systems and robotic deployments.
Its goal is to prevent runaway expansion of automation driven by unmonitored energy scaling.

## 1. Key Indicators

| Indicator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **ECL (Energy Consumption Level)** | Total energy used by AI+robotic systems in a given region or sector. |
| **EPS (Energy Policy Sensitivity)** | How tightly local policies enforce energy use limitations. |
| **AEP (AI-Energy Proportionality)** | Ratio of energy used for AI vs. traditional computation. |

---

## 2. Governance Mechanisms

- **ESL-AUDIT**: Periodic energy tracing reports for AI operations.
- **ESL-LIMIT**: Maximum energy cap per AI deployment cluster.
- **ESL-ALERT**: Alert system for power spikes, signaling risk of AGI runaway.

---

## 3. Strategic Link to RBL-GOV
Excessive energy consumption often signals uncontrolled robot deployment.
ESL acts as an early warning layer that supports RBL-GOV interventions.
