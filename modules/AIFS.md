# AIFS: AI Fraud Spectrum
*Part of the Lori Framework Risk Architecture*

## Overview

**AIFS (AI Fraud Spectrum)** is a multi-dimensional risk mapping module designed to track, classify, and assess emerging AI-driven fraud behaviors. It defines cross-type fraud patterns based on emotional manipulation, identity simulation, and digital impersonation—offering a unified structure for both technical and governance-level analysis.

## 1. Core Fraud Types

| Code | Fraud Type | Characteristics | Method | Target Group |
|------|------------|------------------|--------|--------------|
| A1 | Voice Cloning Fraud | Mimicking family or boss voices | Voice AI phone scams | Elderly, employees |
| A2 | Deepfake Video Fraud | AI-generated videos | Visual + audio deception | Investors, fans |
| A3 | Romance Manipulation | Emotional dependency | Long-term AI chat grooming | Lonely users, seniors |
| A4 | Marriage Scam | False marriage & visa | Simulated documents & personas | Migrants, hopefuls |
| A5 | Immigration Investment Scam | Fake pathways to citizenship | Fake legal teams, platforms | Wealthy individuals |
| A6 | Job Offer Scam | Overseas job lure | Fake interviews, companies | Young job seekers |
| A7 | Sextortion via Chat | Fake flirt traps | Deepfake + blackmail | Teen boys, males |
| A8 | Synthetic Identity Fraud | Fake resumes/accounts | AI-generated docs/images | Students, low-income users |

## 2. Structural Axes
[AI Fraud Spectrum]

├── Emotional Manipulation Axis (Love, Marriage, Empathy)

├── Identity Simulation Axis (Voice, Face, Documents, Profile)

├── Investment-Driven Axis (Greed, Trust, Urgency)

└── Technical Emulation Axis (Synthetic Accounts, Deepfakes, Bots)



→ Each fraud type can be scored by:

• Risk Diffusion Potential

• Tech Complexity

• Emotional Leverage Index

• Mimicry Activation Threshold (MAT)

## 3. Cross-Module Indicators

| Code | Name | Description | Linked Module |
|------|------|-------------|----------------|
| EDRI-H | Emotional Dependency (Elderly) | Risk of long-term AI attachment | EDRI |
| MAT | Mimicry Activation Threshold | Risk of public imitation contagion | Pandora |
| HACI | Human-AI Collusion Index | Traces fraud collaboration signals | MASIF |
| CCV | Community Contagion Velocity | Speed of fraud meme replication | MASIF |
| LII | Linguistic Incendiary Index | Language-based risk ignition | LII |

## 4. Integration & Next Phase

The AIFS module is designed for integration into:
- MASIF (Multi-layered AI Social Impact Framework)
- ODRAF (Outcome-Driven Risk Anticipation Framework)
- Legal AI Risk Protocols
- Public AI Use Guidelines

Coming next:
- Scoring system for each fraud vector
- Narrative case studies for simulation and awareness
- Graph-based threat modeling and mitigation API
