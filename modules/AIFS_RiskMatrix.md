## Criteria Definitions

- **Tech Complexity:** Refers to the level of AI sophistication (deepfake, real-time LLMs, cloning tech).
- **Psychological Depth:** Measures how deeply the fraud engages emotional/identity vulnerabilities.
- **Spread Potential:** Indicates ease of replication or viral dissemination online.
- **Total Risk Score:** Composite score (0â€“1.0) weighted for intervention urgency.

## Risk Tiers (Color Code Reference)

- **0.85â€“1.00:** Critical â€“ Immediate monitoring recommended
- **0.70â€“0.84:** High â€“ Priority watchlist
- **0.50â€“0.69:** Moderate â€“ Context-specific action
- **Below 0.50:** Low â€“ Routine analysis
