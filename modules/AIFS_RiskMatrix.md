# AIFS Risk Matrix: AI Fraud Pattern Analysis

*Part of the AI Fraud Spectrum (AIFS) – Risk Assessment Layer*

This matrix evaluates each AI fraud type based on technical complexity, psychological manipulation depth, social spread potential, and overall risk score. The data supports simulation heatmaps, radar visualizations, and model testing in Lori Framework.

## Criteria Definitions

- **Tech Complexity:** Refers to the level of AI sophistication (deepfake, real-time LLMs, cloning tech).
- **Psychological Depth:** Measures how deeply the fraud engages emotional/identity vulnerabilities.
- **Spread Potential:** Indicates ease of replication or viral dissemination online.
- **Total Risk Score:** Composite score (0–1.0) weighted for intervention urgency.

---

## Risk Tiers (Color Code Reference)

- **0.85–1.00:** Critical – Immediate monitoring recommended
- **0.70–0.84:** High – Priority watchlist
- **0.50–0.69:** Moderate – Context-specific action
- **Below 0.50:** Low – Routine analysis

---

## Integration Points

- Feeds into **AIFS Heatmap** for visualization
- Weighted input for **EDRI-H emotional risk detection**
- Supports **ODRAF** reverse outcome tracing
- Connects to **SAID module** for perception intervention triggers

---

## Example Use

> Scenario A3 (Romance AI Scam) scores 0.88
> → Very High psychological depth
> → Risk of repeat victimization & long-term emotional damage
> → Triggers EDRI-H monitoring, SAID consent checks, high priority flag
