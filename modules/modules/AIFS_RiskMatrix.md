# AIFS Risk Matrix (V1.0)

*Part of the AIFS Module – Lori Framework*

This matrix provides a comparative scoring system for 8 major types of AI-driven fraud, based on five distinct risk dimensions.

---

## 1. Risk Indicators

| Code | Indicator Name | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| ER | Emotional Risk | How strongly the fraud exploits empathy, fear, love, or trust |
| TR | Technical Realism | Realism and sophistication of AI-generated voice, video, or text |
| FR | Financial Impact | Average or potential monetary damage caused |
| MR | Mimicry Risk | Ease with which others can copy the method |
| SR | Social Vulnerability | Likelihood of targeting emotionally or cognitively vulnerable users |

*Each indicator is scored from 1 (low) to 5 (high).*
