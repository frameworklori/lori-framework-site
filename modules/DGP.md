# DGP: Demographic Gap Pressure

## Module Objective
The DGP module assesses how demographic stressâ€”such as aging populations, declining birth rates, or labor shortagesâ€”drives demand for automation and robot deployment.
It helps predict which regions or sectors are more likely to experience replacement pressures.

---

## 1. Key Indicators

| Indicator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **ADR (Aging Dependency Ratio)** | Proportion of elderly population to working-age individuals. |
| **BRD (Birth Rate Decline)** | Rate of decrease in annual births. |
| **LAV (Labor Availability Variance)** | Regional or sectoral gaps in available human workforce. |

---

## 2. Risk Triggers

- **DGP-HIGH**: When ADR + BRD exceed safe thresholds, triggers review of automation policies.
- **DGP-ALERT**: Warns when labor gaps may be filled without ethical review.
- **DGP-TEMP**: Allows for short-term AI/robot support under emergency population stress.

---

## 3. Strategic Link to RBL-GOV
DGP acts as a **root cause driver** that explains *why* robot deployment is being pushed forward.
It supports **pre-emptive human policy interventions** to slow down automation in at-risk societies.

## 4. Related Modules

- [**RBL-GOV**](RBL-GOV.md)
Uses DGP data to determine when to freeze, slow, or review robot integration plans.

- [**RBL**](RBL.md)
Reflects the downstream effect of population stress via increased automation.

- [**ESL**](ESL.md)
Receives indirect impact when demographic pressure leads to energy-intensive AI deployment.
