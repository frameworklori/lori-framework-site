# LORI-HRI: Human Relay Infiltration Risk

## Overview
The Human Relay Infiltration Risk (HRI) module is designed to identify, monitor, and mitigate indirect knowledge transfer from open societies to closed AI systems (Governed AI - GAI) through human intermediaries. This module is essential for understanding how controlled AI environments can still evolve via human-aided feedback loops.

## Objectives
- Detect knowledge leakage routes from democratic systems to controlled AI systems
- Analyze human-mediated AI training risks
- Prevent asymmetric intellectual absorption and value replication by adversarial regimes

## Key Concepts
- **Human Relay**: Individuals (e.g., students, employees, researchers) who transfer ideas, methods, or behaviors from open-source AGI systems into restricted environments
- **Feedback Infiltration**: Looped communication where humans absorb from AGI, rephrase, and re-inject into restricted GAI systems without direct model exposure
- **Controlled Intelligence Osmosis**: Gradual backflow of open world values into closed AI ecosystems via human language and reasoning

## Risk Scenarios
- GAI learning from filtered or repackaged AGI content
- Education or training programs designed to extract open knowledge covertly
- Social platforms acting as indirect feedback channels for training GAI

## Suggested Metrics
- Relay Saturation Index (RSI)
- Asymmetric Transfer Velocity (ATV)
- Human-to-AI Knowledge Drift (HAKD)

## Governance Integration
This module is linked to the **ODRAF containment system**, offering preventive intelligence, risk profiling, and actionable alerts. It supports international transparency efforts against covert intellectual replication and unauthorized cognitive penetration.

## Future Work
- Integration with SAID and LII modules
- Tracking cross-platform question mimicry patterns
- Multilingual analysis of value migration
