> **This module helps you see the danger before imitation becomes a movement.**
> It shows how cultural behaviors, norms, or technologies spread beyond their origin and trigger systemic cracks.

## Core Concepts

### Trigger
The original action, custom, or idea that may be imitated by others.
*Example: A religious burial practice, or an AI-generated scam method.*

### Radius of Mimicry
How far the idea spreads from its origin â€” both socially and geographically.

### Mimicry Activation Threshold (MAT)
The point where individual imitation crosses into group replication.

### Cultural Contagion Velocity (CCV)
How fast the behavior or norm spreads between groups, amplified by media, AI, or social emotion.

### Crack Zone
Where the spread causes **legal, institutional, or social overload**, due to cultural mismatch or systemic stress.

## Purpose

- Prevent system collapse from copycat behavior.
- Alert decision-makers before imitation overwhelms infrastructure or policy.
- Provide **early warning for unintended cultural diffusion**.

---

## Use Cases

- **Religious ritual conflicts (e.g., burial customs spreading across incompatible systems)**
- **AI scam techniques rapidly mimicked across regions**
- **Social media trend leading to public disorder**
- **Extremist ideas re-emerging via cultural imitation**
