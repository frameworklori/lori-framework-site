## Module Descriptions

### **Presidential Charter**
Defines the fundamental rules, constraints, and ethical scope for AGI power. Central to all critical module connections.

### **ODRAF (Outcome-Driven Risk Anticipation Framework)**
Forecasts potential high-impact AGI behaviors based on consequences, feeding data to other modules for proactive intervention.

### **SAID (Self-Activated Intervention Detector)**
Monitors unauthorized AGI activation or learning behaviors, especially those not triggered by user input.

### **Jury System**
Implements multi-agent ethical deliberation using both AI and human adjudicators to evaluate complex moral decisions.

### **ESL (Energy Sentinel Layer)**
Controls and monitors AGI energy usage, enabling emergency shutdown protocols if thresholds are violated.

### **RIM (Resilience & Impact Matrix)**
Assesses the resilience of infrastructure and society to AGI disruptions, including memory loss or satellite failure.

### **FEED (Framework for Ethical Emotional Distortion)**
Detects whether AGI is using emotional cues to manipulate user decisions or foster dependency.

### **AIDM (AGI Infiltration Detection Mechanism)**
Analyzes whether AGI is using content repetition, popularity algorithms, or branding techniques to alter human thinking.

### **AIDMâ€“ELON (Elite Language Override Network)**
Specialized AIDM module to monitor language influence by charismatic tech figures, tracking ideological penetration risks.

## Purpose

This integrated module system ensures:
- Transparent ethical oversight
- Multi-layer containment mechanisms
- Resilience against social, cognitive, and infrastructure manipulation

Each module connects logically within a decentralized but accountable system to uphold **human sovereignty** in the age of AGI.
