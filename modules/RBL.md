# RBL: Robot-Based Labor Integration

## Module Objective
The RBL module tracks the actual deployment of robots and automated systems in various sectors.
It provides real-time metrics on labor replacement, automation speed, and sectoral saturation.

---

## 1. Deployment Indicators

| Indicator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **RDS (Robot Deployment Speed)** | Rate of increase in robotic units over time. |
| **RPI (Robot Penetration Index)** | Proportion of jobs in a sector replaced by robots. |
| **CRR (Critical Role Replacement)** | When essential human roles (e.g. care, education) are substituted by AI/robots. |

---

## 2. Regulation Hooks

- **RBL-CAP**: Maximum limit per region or sector.
- **RBL-REQ**: Requires approval if CRR exceeds cultural or ethical thresholds.
- **RBL-TEMP**: Allows for temp use in crisis zones (e.g. disaster, epidemic).

---

## 3. Strategic Link to RBL-GOV
RBL feeds **real-time deployment data** into RBL-GOV, enabling it to decide when to freeze, rollback, or audit robot usage.
This is the **core operational layer** under governance control.
