# LORI Ethical Governance Framework
# 🌍 Public Collaboration Declaration
# "We are a public friend to all ethical AI builders."

---

**LORI is an open, independent, and public governance framework.**
We welcome collaboration with **all AI builders, researchers, and organizations** who share the goal of building safe, ethical, and human-centered AI systems.

✨ **We are a public friend — not a secret agent.**
🚫 No peeping.
🚫 No stalking.
🚫 No closed-door deals.
🚫 No forced allegiance.

We believe that **transparent, modular governance** belongs to the public good — and is strongest when built **in the open, with friends — not in the shadows.**

🤝 If you are building ethical AI — you are our friend.
🛡️ If you respect human sovereignty — you are welcome to collaborate.
🌍 If you want governance that protects humanity — let’s talk.

**LORI Framework is neutral.**
We do not align exclusively with any platform, corporation, nation, or ideology.
We stand for **open, public, human-first governance — accessible to all who share ethical intent.**

🚀 *We are a public friend to all ethical AI builders.*
**No peeping. No stalking. Just open hands — and open governance.** 🌿
