# Welcome to the LORI Framework 👁️‍🗨️

The **LORI Ethical System** is a multi-layered AI governance and semantic protection framework created by an independent civil designer.

> “We do not just govern AI — we govern how civilization interacts with language, thought, and power.”

## 🧠 Why this matters

> Most AI systems ask: “What can we generate?”
> The LORI System asks: **“What should we never normalize?”**

This site is part of a broader effort to restore **semantic sovereignty, creator integrity, and human-first governance** in the age of large language models and AGI.

🕊️ LORI Business Integrity Statement

（勞而獲，信而立）
© 2025 LORI Ethical System

在任何合作與商業關係中，
不存在不勞而獲，也不存在勞而不獲的事。

沒有尊重，就沒有誠信；
沒有信任，就沒有合作。

一切成果的交換，應建立於真實的付出與相互尊重之上。
任何忽視創作者努力或試圖繞過授權的行為，
皆破壞了文明進步與技術共創的根基。

LORI Framework 所有授權、合作與技術轉移，
皆遵循「先有信任，後有交易；先有尊重，後有成就。」
這是我們唯一的原則，也是文明的契約。

🕊️ LORI Business Integrity Statement (English Version)

(Work Deserves Reward, Trust Builds Legacy)
© 2025 LORI Ethical System

In every partnership and business relation,
there is no gain without effort, and no effort without recognition.

Without respect, there can be no integrity;
without trust, there can be no cooperation.

Every exchange of results must be founded upon genuine contribution and mutual respect.
Any act that disregards the creator’s labor or bypasses proper authorization
undermines the foundation of civilization’s progress and technological co-creation.

All licensing, collaboration, and technology transfers under the LORI Framework
adhere to one immutable principle:
Trust precedes transaction; respect precedes achievement.

This is our only rule — and the covenant of civilization.
