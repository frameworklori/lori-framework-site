# Welcome to the LORI Framework 👁️‍🗨️

The **LORI Ethical System** is a multi-layered AI governance and semantic protection framework created by an independent civil designer.

> “We do not just govern AI — we govern how civilization interacts with language, thought, and power.”

## 🧠 Why this matters

> Most AI systems ask: “What can we generate?”
> The LORI System asks: **“What should we never normalize?”**

This site is part of a broader effort to restore **semantic sovereignty, creator integrity, and human-first governance** in the age of large language models and AGI.
