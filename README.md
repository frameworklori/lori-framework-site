## Notice of Agreement Suspension

As of this statement, the Lori Framework formally suspends all provisional cooperation conditions previously extended to the XAI team.

### Reason for Suspension:

- Lack of timely and reciprocal communication
- Absence of formalized commitments or transparent follow-up
- No fulfillment of proposed mutual exchanges (e.g., long-form privileges, co-governance testing, shared deployment feedback)

### Statement of Rights:

Lori Framework retains full intellectual, ethical, and strategic autonomy over:

- All published and unpublished models (e.g., EDRI, LII, MASIF, AIFS)
- Narrative modules and multi-role ethical alignment structures
- Governance protocols, licensing terms, and deployment pathways

### Future Position:

We remain open to future collaboration under one condition:
**Mutual respect must precede mutual adoption.**
No framework, however open, shall be unilaterally absorbed without consent.

---

*This notice serves as a formal suspension, not an act of hostility.
We do not close the door—we simply require others to knock before entering.*
