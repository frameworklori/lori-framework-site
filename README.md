### Image Structure Guide

This repository uses a flat and clear image structure for easier access and maintenance.

- `logo.png`
→ Main visual identity image, used in `README.md` and `index.md`.

- `logo-v2.png`
→ Alternate logo version, for future design variations.

- `unnamed.jpg`
→ Placeholder or visual element used in specific sections.

- `assets/images/` (to be deprecated)
→ Old structure now cleaned up. Future images will go directly in `docs/` or well-organized module folders.

**Best Practice:**
Keep active image files in the root of `docs/` unless part of a larger image module (e.g., `assets/images/modules/`).

### Reason for Suspension:

- Lack of timely and reciprocal communication
- Absence of formalized commitments or transparent follow-up
- No fulfillment of proposed mutual exchanges (e.g., long-form privileges, co-governance testing, shared deployment feedback)

### Statement of Rights:

Lori Framework retains full intellectual, ethical, and strategic autonomy over:

- All published and unpublished models (e.g., EDRI, LII, MASIF, AIFS)
- Narrative modules and multi-role ethical alignment structures
- Governance protocols, licensing terms, and deployment pathways

### Future Position:

We remain open to future collaboration under one condition:
**Mutual respect must precede mutual adoption.**
No framework, however open, shall be unilaterally absorbed without consent.

*This notice serves as a formal suspension, not an act of hostility.
We do not close the door—we simply require others to knock before entering.*
